<h2>TO THE READER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the issue to the public of the curious chronicle of
"Rasputin the Rascal Monk," based upon official documents,
and its translation into a number of languages,
I received from the same sources in Russia a bulky
manuscript upon very thin paper which contained certain
confessions, revelations, and allegations made by its
writer, F&eacute;odor Rajevski, who acted as the mock-saint's
secretary and body-servant, and who, in consequence, was
for some years in a position to know the most inner
secrets of Rasputin's dealings with those scoundrelly men
and women who betrayed Holy Russia into the hands of
the Hun.</p>

<p>This manuscript, to-day before me as I write, is mostly
in Italian, for Rajevski, the son of a Polish violinist, lived
many years of his youth in Bologna, Florence, and old-world
Siena, hence, in writing his memoirs, he used the
language most familiar to him, and one perhaps more
readily translated by anyone living outside Russia.</p>

<p>In certain passages I have been compelled to
disguise names of those who, first becoming tools of
the mock-saint, yet afterwards discovering him to be a
charlatan, arose in their patriotism and&mdash;like Rajevski
who here confesses&mdash;watched patiently, and as Revolutionists
became instrumental in the amazing charlatan's
downfall and his ignominious death.</p>

<p>These startling revelations of the secretary to the
head of the "dark forces" in Russia, as they were known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a>[<a href="./images/iv.png">iv</a>]</span>
in the Duma, are certainly most amazing and unusually
startling, forming as they do a disgraceful secret page
of history that will prove of outstanding interest to those
who come after us.</p>

<p>I confess that when first I read through the bald statements
of fact, which I have here endeavoured to place in
readable form for British readers, I became absorbed&mdash;therefore
I venture to believe that they will be just as
interesting to others who read them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">rasputin meets the empress</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Spanish author Yriarte wrote those very true words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Y ahora digo yo; llene un volumen</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>De disparates un Autor famoso,</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>Y si no alabaren, que me emplumen.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For those who do not read Spanish I would translate
the passage as:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now I say to you; let an author of renown fill a
book with twaddle, and if it is not praised by the critics,
you may tar and feather me."</p></div>

<p>I am not an author of renown. Indeed, I make no
pretence of the delicacies of literary style, or the turning
of fine phrases of elegant diplomacy. My object is merely
to record in these pages the truth regarding the crumbling
of Russia, and the downfall of our Imperial Throne.</p>

<p>Anyone who cares to search the voluminous records
in the Bureau of Police in the long Bibikovsky Boulevard,
in Kiev, will find my <i>dossier</i> neatly filed and tabulated, as
are those of most Russians. You will find that I, F&eacute;odor,
son of F&eacute;odor Rajevski, musician temporarily abroad,
and his wife Varvara, was born in the Via Galliera, at
Bologna, in Italy, on July 8, 1880, and on March 3, 1897,
entered the University in the Vladimirskaya. I venture
to think that the police have but little inscribed to my
detriment save perhaps a few students' pranks in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
Kreshtchatik, and the record of that memorable night
when we daubed with blue and white paint the equestrian
statue in front of the Merchants' Club, and I was fined
twenty roubles by the bearded old magistrate for the part
I played in the joke.</p>

<p>Had there been anything serious against me I doubt
whether I should have occupied, as I did for some years,
the post of confidential secretary to "Grichka," that
saintly unwashed charlatan whose real name was Gregory
Novikh, and whom the world knew by the nickname of
"Rasputin."</p>

<p>Of my youth I need say but little. After my student
days I obtained, through the influence of a high Government
official named Branicki, a friend of my father, a
clerical post in the bureau of political police of the Empire,
a department of the Ministry of the Interior, and for
several years pursued a calm, uneventful life in that
capacity. In consequence of a grave scandal discovered
in my department&mdash;for my chief had secured the conviction
of a certain wealthy nobleman named Tiniacheff, in
Kharkoff, who was perfectly innocent of any offence&mdash;I
was one day called as witness by the court of inquiry
sitting in Moscow.</p>

<p>It was at that inquiry early in 1903 that I first met
General Kouropatkine, who at that time had risen to high
favour with Her Majesty the Empress and was&mdash;as was
afterwards discovered&mdash;urging the Tsar to make war
against Japan, well knowing that any attacks by us would
be foredoomed to failure. At the General's instigation I
was transferred to the Ministry of War as an under-secretary
in his Cabinet, and he sent me&mdash;on account of
my knowledge of Italian&mdash;upon a confidential mission to
Milan. This, I presume, I carried out entirely to his
satisfaction, for on two other occasions I was sent to Italy
with messages to a certain Baron Svereff, a rich Russian
financier living in San Remo, and with whom no doubt
Kouropatkine was engaged in traitorous dealings.</p>

<p>One day, having been called by telephone to the house
of His Excellency, I found, seated in his big luxuriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
furnished room, and chatting confidentially, a strange-looking,
unkempt, sallow-faced man of thirty or so, with
broad brow, narrow sunken cheeks, and long untrimmed
beard, who, as soon as he turned his big deep-set eyes
upon mine, held me in fascination.</p>

<p>His was a most striking countenance, broad in the
protruding forehead which narrowed to the point of his
black beard, and being dressed as a monk in a long,
shabby, black robe I recognised at once he was one of
those fakirs we have all over Russia, one of those self-sacrificing
bogus "holy" men who wander from town to
town obsessed by religious mania, full of fictitious self-denial,
yet collecting kopecks for charity.</p>

<p>Religion of all creeds has its esoteric phases, and our
own Greek Church is certainly not alone in its "cranks."</p>

<p>"Rajevski, this is the Starets, Gregory Novikh," said
the General, who was in uniform with the cross of St.
Andrew at his throat.</p>

<p>I stood for a few seconds astounded. On being introduced
to me, the unkempt, uncleanly fellow crossed his
arms over his chest, bowed, and growled in a deep voice
a word of benediction.</p>

<p>I expressed pleasure at meeting him, for all Russia
was at the moment ringing with the renown of the
modest Siberian "saint" who could work miracles. For
the past month or so the name of "Grichka" had been
upon everyone's lips. The ignorant millions from the
Volga to Vladivostok had been told that a new saint had
arisen in Russia; one possessed of Divine influence; a
man who lived such a clean and blameless life in imitation
of Christ that he was destined as the spiritual Guide and
Protector of Russia, and to eclipse even Saint Nicholas
himself.</p>

<p>As one level-headed and educated I had always had my
doubts concerning all "holy" wanderers who meander
across the steppes collecting alms. Knowing much of the
evil life lived in our Russian monasteries and convents,
and the warm welcome given to every charlatan who grows
his beard, forgets to wash, lifts his eyes heavenwards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
and begs, I had, I confess at the outset, but little faith in
this new star in Holy Russia's firmament now introduced
to me by His Excellency the Minister of War.</p>

<p>"I have been speaking with the Starets concerning
you," the Minister said, as he turned in his padded chair,
and flicked the ash from his exquisite Bogdanoff cigarette.
"I have detached you from my department to become
secretary to the Starets. Yours will be an enviable post,
my dear F&eacute;odor, I assure you. Russia is in her degeneration.
The Starets has been sent to us by Divine Providence
to regenerate and reform her."</p>

<p>"But, your Excellency, I am very content in my
present post&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I issued the decree from the Ministry this morning,"
he interrupted in his fierce, blustering manner, that manner
which, years later, carried him through the war with
Japan. "It is all arranged. You are the secretary of
our protector whom Almighty God has sent to Russia for
our salvation."</p>

<p>My eyes met the piercing gaze of the unkempt
scoundrel, and, to my surprise, I found myself held mystified.
Never before had any man or woman exercised such
an all-powerful influence over me by merely gazing at me.
That it was hypnotic was without doubt. The fellow himself
with his sallow cheeks, his black beard, his deep-set
eyes, and his broad brow was the very counterpart of
those portraits which the old cinquecento artists of Italy
painted of criminal aristocrats.</p>

<p>In the Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence, in the great
gallery in Siena; in Venice, Rome, and Milan hung
dozens of portraits resembling closely that of Gregory
Novikh, the man who, to my own knowledge as I intend
to here show, betrayed Russia, and destroyed the Imperial
House of Romanoff.</p>

<p>In that look I had foreseen in him something terrible;
I had read the whole of his destiny in his glance. His
gaze for the moment overwhelmed me. Once or twice in
my life&mdash;as it comes to most men&mdash;I have met with that
expression in the countenances of those I have come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
across: it presaged crime, and the prophecy, alas! has
been verified. Crime was in Gregory Novikh.</p>

<p>Perhaps Rasputin&mdash;as the world called him and as I
will call him&mdash;knew that crime was in him. I think he
did. By his eyes I knew him to be a criminal sensualist
with murder in his heart.</p>

<p>I had heard a whisper of his sordid and miserable
elemental passions, even though the Starets was, next to
His Majesty the Tsar, the most popular man in all the
Empire.</p>

<p>To be appointed his confidential secretary was surely
great advancement at a single bound, for though sensuality
was to him as natural as the air he breathed, yet
he had the highest society of Petrograd already at his
feet.</p>

<p>Compelled to accept my unwanted appointment, I
bowed, and expressed gratification that I should have
been chosen for such a post.</p>

<p>"You must be discreet, my dear F&eacute;odor," said His
Excellency, throwing his cigarette end into the great
bronze bowl at his elbow. "When I have sent you upon
confidential missions you have been as dumb as an oyster.
This new post I give to you because I know that you are
a true patriotic Russian, and if you see and know certain
things you will never chatter about them to the detriment
of myself, or of our very good friend Grichka. To him,
remember, everything is permitted. You will learn much,
but rather than speak let your tongue be cut out. And
that," he added, looking at me very seriously as he
lowered his voice, "and that, I warn you, will be the
judgment upon you in the fortress of Schl&uuml;sselburg if you
dare to divulge a single secret of Russia's saviour!"</p>

<p>I stood aghast between this all-powerful War Minister
in his glittering decorations, the Emperor's right hand
and confidant, and the unkempt, ragged, wandering
collector of kopecks&mdash;the man whose eyes held me in their
fascination each time they met my gaze.</p>

<p>The suddenness of it all bewildered me. The salary
I was to receive, as mentioned by His Excellency, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
most generous, indeed, more than double that which I
had been paid by the Ministry of War. It meant luxury
beyond my wildest dreams; a life of ease, affluence, and
influence.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder therefore that I accepted it, little
knowing in those days of peace that I was a pawn in the
great game of the Hun?</p>

<p>How shall I describe Rasputin? My pen fails me.
He was one of a few great charlatans of saintly presence
and of specious words, fascinators of women, and
domineerers of men, who have been sent to the world at
intervals through all the ages. Had he lived in the twelfth
or thirteenth century of our era he would no doubt have
been canonised. This rough, uncouth, illiterate Siberian
peasant, who had been convicted of horse-stealing, and of
immorality, who had served years of imprisonment in the
gaol at Tobolsk, and who had only a month before we met
been flung out of a monastery in Odessa and kicked half
to death by its inmates as a fraud, had actually become
the most popular person in Petrograd.</p>

<p>With the women of the aristocracy he was well-known,
but to the Imperial Court he had not risen. Yet, being a
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Kouropatkine, matters were no doubt being
arranged, although I was, of course, in ignorance of the
traitorous plans in progress.</p>

<p>On the following morning, according to my instructions
given me by my new chief, I called upon him at the
small ground-floor flat which he occupied in the Poltavskaya,
close to the Nicholas Station. The house, the remaining
rooms of which were unoccupied, was a dark
forbidding-looking one, with a heavy door beneath a
portico, and containing deep cellars into which nobody
ever penetrated save the Starets himself.</p>

<p>On the morning of my first visit there, I was, from
the beginning, much mystified. The dining-room was
quite a luxurious apartment, so was the "saint's" study&mdash;a
den with a soft Eastern carpet, a big writing-table, a
high porcelain stove of chocolate and white, and silk-upholstered
settees. From this den a door opened into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
the "holy" man's sleeping-room, an apartment of spartan
plainness save for its big stove, a replica of the one in
the study.</p>

<p>The household, I found, consisted of one other person,
an old Siberian peasant woman of about sixty, named
Anna, who came from Pokrovsky, the "saint's" native
village. She acted as housekeeper and maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>That first morning spent with Rasputin was full of
interest. He was a dirty, uncouth, illiterate fellow who
repelled me. His hands were hard, his fingers knotty,
his face was of a distinctly criminal type, and yet in my
bewilderment I remembered that General Kouropatkine
had declared him to be sent by the Almighty as the Protector
of Russia.</p>

<p>His conversation was coarse and overbearing, and
interlarded by quotations from Holy Writ. He mentioned
to me certain ladies in high society, and related,
with a broad grin upon his saintly countenance, scandal
after scandal till I stood aghast.</p>

<p>Truly the "saint" was a most remarkable personality.
From the first I had been compelled to admit that whatever
the Russian public had said, there was a certain
amount of basis for the gossip. His was the most weird
and compelling personality that I had ever met. Even
Stolypin had been impressed by him, though the Holy
Synod had declared him to be a fraud.</p>

<p>My work consisted of reading to him and replying to
letters from hundreds of women who had become
attracted by his peculiar distorted emotional religion,
many of whom desired to enter the cult which he had
established. As secretary it was also my duty to arrange
for the weekly reunions of the "sister-disciples," held in
a big bare upstairs room, in which hung a holy ikon and
several sacred pictures, and in which the mysteries of his
"religion" were practised.</p>

<p>Ere long, I found that to those weekly s&eacute;ances there
flocked many of the wealthiest and most cultured women
in Petrograd, who actually held the ex-horse-stealer in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
veneration, and believed, as the peasants believed, that he
could work miracles.</p>

<p>One afternoon, after I had been nearly a month in
Rasputin's service, Boris St&uuml;rmer, a well-known Court
sycophant, with bristling hair and a sweeping goatee
beard, was brought to the monk by Kouropatkine. Both
were in uniform, and after ushering them into Rasputin's
study I felt that some dark conspiracy was on foot.</p>

<p>They remained in council for nearly an hour when I
was called into the room, and to me, as the monk's right
hand, the plot was explained so that I could assist in it.</p>

<p>To me the German St&uuml;rmer, who afterwards rose to be
Prime Minister of Russia, was no stranger. Indeed, it
was he who, inviting me to be seated, explained what was
in progress.</p>

<p>"It is necessary, Rajevski, that the Father should
meet Her Majesty the Empress. He is our saviour, and
it is but right that he should come to the Imperial Court.
But he cannot be introduced by any of the ordinary
channels. Her Majesty must be impressed, and her
curiosity aroused."</p>

<p>I bowed in assent, little dreaming of the devilish
scheme which, instigated from Potsdam, and paid for by
German gold, was about to be worked. Already Germany
had decided to conquer Russia, and already the far-seeing
Kaiser had watched and recognised that he could use
Rasputin's undoubted influence in our priest-ridden
country for his own dastardly ends.</p>

<p>"Now," continued St&uuml;rmer, stroking his beard as he
looked at me. "We have just discovered that Her
Majesty intends to pay a visit incognita next Friday to the
shrine of Our Lady at Kazan, in order to pray for the
birth of an heir to the Romanoffs. We have therefore
decided that our Father shall go to Kazan, and be found
by the Empress praying before the shrine beseeching the
Almighty to grant Her Majesty her fond desire. He will
appear to her a perfect stranger uttering exactly the same
prayer as that in her mind."</p>

<p>"They will not speak," Kouropatkine added. "Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
Father will apparently take no notice of her save to
glance into her face, for why should he recognise in her
the Empress?"</p>

<p>I saw with what ingenuity the plan was being laid, for
well I knew the amazing and quite uncanny fascination
for women of all classes possessed by the Starets.</p>

<p>At the time I naturally believed that St&uuml;rmer and his
friend Kouropatkine were both convinced that it would
be to the advantage of Russia if the holy man gained
admission to the Imperial Court as spiritual guide to
Nicholas II. Such a widely popular figure had the Starets
become, and so deeply impressed had been the people of
Moscow and Warsaw, where he had performed some
mysterious "miracles," that there were hundreds of
thousands of all classes who, like the two Ministers of the
Crown who sat in that room, really believed that he was
possessed of Divine power.</p>

<p>As we walked in the Nevski, people, mostly women,
would rush to him and kiss his dirty hand, or raise the
hem of his greasy kaftan to their lips, asking for the
Father's blessing. By the enlightened Western peoples
the ignorance and superstitions of our great Russian
people cannot be understood. You, who have travelled
in our Holy Russia, know our trackless country where
settlements are to distances, as one of our writers has put
it, as fly-specks upon window-panes, where whole villages
are the prey of disease, and where seventy-nine people out
of every hundred cannot read or write. You also know
how in the corner of every room hangs the ikon, how the
gold or blue-domed basilica strikes you in every street,
the long-haired priests chanting in their deep bass, the
passer-by ceaselessly crossing himself, the peasantry
crushed and down-trodden, and the middle and upper
classes lapped in luxury and esteeming good manners
more highly than morals. Such is Russia of to-day&mdash;Russia
in the age of my employer Rasputin, the era of
the downfall of the Imperial Romanoffs, and the fierce
struggle with the barbaric Hun.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan formed by Boris St&uuml;rmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
I next day accompanied the Starets by rail direct to Nijni
Novgorod, by way of Moscow, thence taking steamer
down the great Volga, a twelve-hour journey, to that city
where they make bells and ikons, Kazan.</p>

<p>Rasputin had put on his oldest and most ragged
monk's habit, and carried a staff. Over his threadbare
dress he wore another of finer texture which it was his
intention to discard ere entering before the shrine, in
order to appear most lowly and humble in the eyes of the
shrewd Tsaritza. We left Petrograd at night, that our
departure should not be known and commented upon, but
ere we did so I received a note from the General to the
effect that the director of Secret Police at Tsarskoe-Selo
had telephoned that Her Majesty was not leaving till the
following day.</p>

<p>Hence we were travelling a day ahead of the Empress.</p>

<p>Kazan is a city full of the odour of sanctity if judged
by the number of priests and monks one meets in its
streets. It is situated about seven versts from the river,
an old-world picturesque place wherein one rubs shoulders
with people in all sorts of curious costumes, especially in
the Tartar suburb where the low houses border upon
narrow unpaved streets dotted here and there with
mosques.</p>

<p>On arrival we drove up the hill to the great Preobrazhensky
Monastery where Rasputin, as became a holy man,
sought hospitality and was immediately very warmly
welcomed, while I afterwards went on to the Hotel
Frantsiya, in the long busy Vozkrensenkaya, where I took
a room in order to watch the arrival of Alexandra Feodorovna,
who would travel incognita, and of whose
coming I was to give warning to Grichka.</p>

<p>For two days I waited, ever on the alert, and, of
course, interested in the adventure. It is not always that
one waits in an hotel in expectation of the arrival of an
empress. Meanwhile I had made friends with the hotel
clerk, without, of course, explaining my business, and he
had promised to tell me of all new arrivals.</p>

<p>The Frantsiya is a very comfortable hotel, conducted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
upon French lines, and the two days I spent in Kazan
were certainly quite enjoyable ones.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day my friend the hotel
clerk sent a message to my room, and in response I at
once descended to the bureau, when he informed me that
the ladies had just arrived, a Madame Strepoff, and her
maid Mademoiselle Kamensky. He described the first-named,
and I at once recognised her as the Tsaritza herself,
though, of course, the tall, pale young man had no
idea of her identity. I had merely told him that I expected
the arrival of a lady whom I had met in Moscow
some time ago.</p>

<p>"Madame has taken the best suite of rooms in the
hotel," the clerk said. "She is evidently an aristocrat
though she is only Madame Strepoff. I have just sent
their passports to the police."</p>

<p>The hour was immediately before dinner, therefore I
lounged about the entrance hall awaiting the appearance
of the two travellers who, the clerk had told me, had not
ordered dinner in their rooms, so evidently they intended
to dine in the public restaurant.</p>

<p>Just after half-past seven they descended the broad
staircase. There was but little difference in their ages.
In an instant I recognised the handsome Empress by the
many photographs I had seen. The other, dark and also
good-looking, was evidently a lady-in-waiting, a lady
whom I afterwards met at Court.</p>

<p>The pair, dressed inconspicuously in black, seated
themselves at a little <i>table &agrave; deux</i> in the window, while I
followed, and having selected a table opposite, ate my
meal as I watched.</p>

<p>The Empress in incognita seemed in high spirits,
perhaps because she had escaped from the Imperial Court.
She chatted confidentially with her companion, and more
than once cast an inquiring glance in my direction, as
though wondering whether I were not an agent of the
Okhrana, the ubiquitous secret police of the Empire. It
is only too true that wherever one goes in Russia one is
"shadowed" by the police, and Her Majesty knew full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
well that the bureau of "personal police" at Tsarskoe-Selo
would know that she had left the palace and would
keep an eye upon her, because just about that period the
air was full of plots against the dynasty.</p>

<p>The Empress and her bosom friend Mademoiselle
Z&eacute;neide Kamensky&mdash;whom I afterwards knew her to be&mdash;finished
their meal unrecognised by the servants, or any
of those in the restaurant, and then returned to their
rooms. Afterwards I took a droshky up to the Preobrazhensky
Monastery, which I reached about ten o'clock.
The old monk who answered my ring at the barred door
returned with a message from Rasputin to the effect that I
was to tell him the object of my visit. This I refused to
do, and became insistent upon seeing him. Such hesitation
on Rasputin's part greatly surprised me. Indeed, it
was not before nearly half an hour had elapsed that the
long-bearded old janitor unwillingly conducted me through
the long, bare corridors of the monastery where my footsteps
on the flags awakened the echoes, and after several
turns ushered me into a small, well-furnished room,
wherein, in an armchair before the stove, sat the charlatan
who was posing as the Saviour of Russia.</p>

<p>In an instant I realised that he was in an advanced
state of intoxication. As I entered he rose unsteadily,
and addressing me declared that life in the Spasso-Preobrazhensky
was most pleasant, and at once began
singing a ribald song.</p>

<p>I stood aghast. This was the man who, by the
scheming of St&uuml;rmer and his catspaw, was to be introduced
to the Imperial Court! So fuddled was he by
vodka that he was unable to understand the purport of my
visit. He merely laughed inanely and began to repeat
parrot-like those curious prayers which he recited at the
weekly reunions of the sister-disciples&mdash;passages culled
haphazard from Holy Writ, interspersed with the most
obscene and ribald allegations, a jumble of piety and
blasphemy that none could ever understand.</p>

<p>Soon I realised the hopelessness of the situation.
This was the first I knew that the "saint" was addicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
to alcohol, although he drank wine freely at meals and
always kept champagne for his friends, paid for out of his
collections for charity. In his inebriated state his wild-looking
eyes glowed like coals, and as he looked at me I
experienced once more the strange sensation of being
enthralled. Truly, there was something mesmeric about
that gaze of his, a mystery that I have never solved.</p>

<p>A priest entered after I had been there a few minutes,
and to him I remarked that the Father being "rather
unwell" I would return early next day. He smiled
meaningly, and I departed.</p>

<p>Having no knowledge of what hour the Empress intended
to visit the shrine of Our Lady, I was back again
at the monastery at dawn when I found the Starets had
quite recovered. As soon as I told him of the presence
of the Tsaritza he bustled about, and in his oldest robe,
rusty, travel-worn and frayed, he accompanied me to the
fine church of Bogoroditsky.</p>

<p>It was then only seven o'clock, and we found the
church with its many candles and its much venerated
shrine quite deserted save for one or two peasant women
who had halted to pray on their way to work.</p>

<p>Outside we stood together gazing down the long white
road which led from the direction of the Hotel Frantsiya.</p>

<p>"Alexandra Feodorovna must certainly come this
way," remarked the ragged "saint" as I stood at his
side. "Remain here and keep watch. I shall go to
yonder house and speak with the people. When the
carriage approaches, let me know quickly."</p>

<p>Then leaving me the Starets crossed to a small house
which he entered to give its inmates his blessing&mdash;blessing
forsooth from such an unholy, unwashed scoundrel!</p>

<p>Through an hour I waited in patience, until in the
distance I saw a carriage approaching, and at once gave
warning, whereupon the Father entered the church and
threw himself upon his knees devoutly before the holy
shrine and began to pray earnestly aloud in his deep bass.</p>

<p>I had entered after him, and secreting myself behind
one of the massive pillars watched the arrival of the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
females in dead black, who, crossing themselves as they
entered, approached the shrine.</p>

<p>As they did so Rasputin, apparently unconscious of
their presence, cried in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"O God! in Thy gracious bounty give unto our Imperial
House of Romanoff a son&mdash;one who shall in due
time wear the glorious crown of the Tsars and become
the Sovereign Defender of All the Russias against our
enemies. In this my prayer I most humbly echo the
voice of Russia's millions, whose dearest wish is that a
son be born unto our Imperial House. O God, I beseech
thee to grant us our request!"</p>

<p>From my place of concealment I saw the Tsaritza start
visibly. She wore a veil, so that I could not see her
countenance. She had halted, entranced by overhearing
that prayer uttered by the unkempt stranger. I noticed
that she whispered a word to her companion, who, like
herself, was veiled, and then Her Majesty threw herself
upon her knees, an example followed by Mademoiselle
Kamensky.</p>

<p>The Empress, her head bowed in silence, knelt before
the weird impressive shrine, side by side with the Starets.
The great church was dark save for the light of the
myriad candles, and silent save for the twittering of a
bird, yet I could see that the pious exhortation of Rasputin
had been taken as an omen by Her Majesty.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the mock saint's voice again rang out
clearly in the great cavernous basilica as he repeated the
prayer in clear impassioned words&mdash;that same prayer
which the Empress was repeating in silence.</p>

<p>Only the three knelt there. For a full ten minutes
silence again reigned. Neither of the kneeling figures
stirred until Rasputin crossed himself slowly, and for a
third time, raising his voice still higher he besought the
Almighty to grant Russia an heir to the Throne.</p>

<p>Then, at last, he rose with slow dignity as became
a saintly priest, and again he made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>As he did so the Empress who had raised her veil
turned her head, whereupon he halted for several seconds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
and gazed straight into her face with that intense,
hypnotic stare which always held women in such mysterious
fascination. I saw that the Empress was again
startled, but folding his hands across his breast, an
attitude habitual to him, the Starets passed out of the
church without a second glance at her, leaving her breathless
and trembling.</p>

<p>When he had gone she turned in alarm and whispered
with her lady-in-waiting. Both women rose, and, following
the monk, stood gazing at his receding figure as he
went down the long white road.</p>

<p>"A strange man surely, Z&eacute;neide!" I heard the Empress
exclaim. "How curious that, unconscious of my
presence, he should be here, praying for me&mdash;a holy man
without a doubt! We must discover who he is. What
eyes! Did you notice them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His gaze really frightened me," her companion
admitted.</p>

<p>"Ah! His is the face of a true saint&mdash;a wonder-worker!
Of that I am certain. We must make inquiries
concerning him," remarked Her Majesty. "I must see
him again and speak with him!"</p>

<p>Then the pair, entering the carriage, drove rapidly
away.</p>

<p>While standing upon the church steps they had discussed
the Starets while I had lounged close by unnoticed,
believing that we were alone.</p>

<p>As the carriage moved off, however, I was startled to
feel strong hands laid heavily upon me, as a rough voice
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Halt! You are under arrest!"</p>

<p>Next second I became aware that I was in the hands
of two rather well dressed men, no doubt agents of the
Okhrana.</p>

<p>"You have been loitering here with evil intent!"
exclaimed the elder of the pair. "We have been watching
you ever since you entered behind that good
Father. We saw you secrete yourself. Have you
any firearms?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
I unfortunately had a revolver, and at once produced
it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the brown-bearded agent of Secret
Police as he took possession of it. "I thought so! You
had discovered the identity of the lady with the long veil,
and have been here awaiting an opportunity to fire at
her!"</p>

<p>"What?" I gasped, aghast at the serious charge
levelled against me. "I am no revolutionist! I carry
that weapon merely for my self-protection."</p>

<p>The bearded man gave a low whistle, and next moment
three grey-coated policemen in uniform sprang up from
nowhere, and I was unceremoniously marched through
the streets to the head police bureau in the Gostiny
Dvor, well knowing the seriousness of the allegation
against me.</p>

<p>Two hours later I was taken to the dark-panelled room
of the Chief of Police, a bald-headed, flabby-faced functionary
in a dark blue uniform glittering with decorations.
Before his big table, standing between two policemen,
I answered question after question he put to me, my
replies being carefully noted by a clerk who sat at a side
table. In the room were also the two officers of the
Okhrana who had travelled, unknown to the Empress, in
order to keep Her Majesty beneath their surveillance.</p>

<p>"Why did you arrive at the Frantsiya and await the
coming of the two ladies?" snapped the Chief of Police
in his peculiarly offensive manner.</p>

<p>I was at loss what to say. I was unable to tell the
truth lest I should betray the plot of Boris St&uuml;rmer and
General Kouropatkine. I recollected my friendship with
the hotel clerk, and my eagerness for the arrival of the
travellers.</p>

<p>"Ah! You hesitate!" said the all-powerful functionary
with a sinister grin, and knowing what I did of
the political police and their arbitrary measures towards
those suspected, I realised that I was in very grave
danger.</p>

<p>"You had secret knowledge of Her Majesty's journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
incognita, or you would not have been watching in the
church with a loaded revolver in your pocket," he went
on. "Your Brothers of Freedom, as you term them,
never lack knowledge of Their Majesties' movements,"
my inquisitor said.</p>

<p>"I deny, your Excellency, that I was there with any
evil intent," I protested. "Such a thing as you suggest
never for a second entered my mind."</p>

<p>The man in the brilliant uniform laughed, saying:</p>

<p>"I have heard that same declaration before. It is a
clever plot, no doubt, but fortunately you were watched,
and the knowledge that you were being watched prevented
you from putting your plans into execution. Come&mdash;confess!"</p>

<p>"I had no idea that I was being watched until I was
arrested," I declared.</p>

<p>"But you cannot explain the reason why you travelled
from Petrograd to Kazan. Let us hear your excuse," he
said with increased sarcasm.</p>

<p>"I have no excuse," was my very lame reply. I was
wondering what had become of the Starets. It was quite
evident that they knew nothing of my double journey up
to the monastery, and further, there was no suspicion
against Rasputin. That being so I hesitated to explain
the truth, in the faint hope that Kouropatkine, as Minister
of War, would hear of my arrest, and contrive to obtain
my release. I saw that, at least, I ought to remain loyal
to those who employed me, and further, even if I told the
truth it would not be believed.</p>

<p>"It will be best to make some inquiries in Petrograd
regarding this individual," suggested the police agent
who had arrested me.</p>

<p>"I really don't think that is necessary," replied the
Chief of Police of Kazan, tapping his desk impatiently
with his pen, as he turned to me and said:</p>

<p>"Now, tell me quickly, young man. Why are you
here?"</p>

<p>What could I reply?</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, smiling. "I see that there are others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
whom you refuse to implicate. It is useless to send such
people as you for trial."</p>

<p>"But I demand a fair trial!" I cried in desperation,
a cold sweat breaking out on my brow, because I knew
that he had power to pass sentence upon me as a political
suspect who refused information&mdash;and that his order
would certainly be confirmed by the Minister of the
Interior.</p>

<p>Too well did I know the drastic powers of the Chiefs
of Police of the principal cities.</p>

<p>At my demand the bald-headed man simply smiled, and
replied:</p>

<p>"My order is that you be conveyed to Schl&uuml;sselburg.
You will there have plenty of leisure in which to repent
not having replied to my questions."</p>

<p>To Schl&uuml;sselburg! My heart fell within me. Once
within that dreaded fortress, the terrible oubliettes of
which are below the surface of the Lake Ladoga, my
identity would be lost and I should be quickly forgotten.
From Schl&uuml;sselburg no prisoner ever returned!</p>

<p>Would any of the conspiring trio, whose tool I had
been, raise a finger to save me? Or would they consider
that having served their purpose it would be to their
advantage if my lips were closed?</p>

<p>"Schl&uuml;sselburg!" I gasped. "No&mdash;no, not that!" I
cried. "I am innocent&mdash;quite innocent!"</p>

<p>"You give no proof of it," coldly replied the Chief of
Police, rising as a sign that the inquiry was at an end.
"My orders are that you be sent to Schl&uuml;sselburg
without delay." Then, turning to the two agents of
the Okhrana, he added: "You will report this to your
director at Tsarskoe-Selo. I will send my order to the
Ministry for confirmation to-night. Take the prisoner
away!"</p>

<p>And next moment I was bundled down to a dirty cell
in the basement, there to await conveyance to that most
dreaded of all the prisons in the Empire.</p>

<p>By a single stroke of the pen I had been condemned
to imprisonment for life!</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">rasputin enters tsarskoe-selo</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I confess</span> that I felt my position to be absolutely hopeless.</p>

<p>I was a political suspect, and therefore I knew full
well that to attempt to communicate with anyone outside
was quite impossible. The Chief of Police of Kazan,
honestly believing that he was doing his duty and unearthing
a subtle plot against the life of the Empress, on
account of the revolver in my possession, had condemned
me to imprisonment in the Fortress of Schl&uuml;sselburg. Its
very name, dreaded by every Russian, recurred to me as
I recollected Kouropatkine's significant words. Had he
not threatened that, if I revealed one single word of the
secret doings of the holy Starets, my tongue would be
cut out within those grim dark walls of that prison of
mystery?</p>

<p>We Russians had from our childhood heard of that
sinister fortress, the walls of which rise sheer from the
black waters of Lake Ladoga&mdash;that place where the cells
of the political prisoners, victims of the thousand and one
intrigues of the Russian bureaucracy, consequent upon
the autocracy of the Tsar, are deep beneath the lake's
surface, so that they can&mdash;when it is willed by the
Governor or those higher Ministers who express their
devilish desire&mdash;be flooded at will.</p>

<p>Hundreds of terrified, yet innocent and nameless
victims of Russia's medi&aelig;val barbarism, persons of both
sexes&mdash;alas! that I should speak so of my own country&mdash;have,
during the past ten years of enlightenment, stood
in their narrow dimly-lit oubliette and watched in horror
the black tide trickle through the rat holes in the stone
floor, slowly, ever slowly, until water has filled the cell
to the arched stone roof and drowned them as rats in a
trap.</p>

<p>And all that has been done by the accursed German
wirepullers in the name of the puny puppet who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
Tsar, and from whom the truth was, they said, ever carefully
hidden.</p>

<p>The Kazan police treated me just as inhumanly as I
expected. By my own experience as an official in the
Department of Political Police, and knowing what I did
in consequence, I was expecting all this.</p>

<p>Four days I spent in that gloomy, but not very uncomfortable
cell in Kazan, when, on the fifth morning, I was
taken, handcuffed to another prisoner who I found afterwards
had murdered his wife, to the Volga steamer which,
after twelve hours of close confinement, landed us at Nijni.</p>

<p>A hundred times I debated within myself whether it
were best to remain silent, and not reveal my past career
in the Department of Political Police, or to state the
absolute facts and struggle by that means to obtain a
hearing and escape.</p>

<p>One fact was patent. General Kouropatkine and Boris
St&uuml;rmer both trusted in my silence, while the rascal monk
had found in me a catspaw who had remained dumb. In
truth, however, my secret intention was to watch the
progress of events. Of the latter, Rasputin had, of course,
no suspicion. If I were&mdash;as I had already proved myself&mdash;his
willing assistant, then he and his friends might
endeavour to save me.</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts as I sat in the train between
two police agents on the interminable journey from Nijni
to the capital.</p>

<p>On arrival at the Nicholas Station the murderer to
whom I was manacled and myself were shown no consideration.
We had been without food for twelve hours,
yet the three men in charge, though they ate a hearty meal
in the buffet, gave us not a drink of water. Humanity is
not in the vocabulary of our police of Russia when dealing
with political suspects, so many of whom are entirely innocent
persons who have proved themselves obnoxious to
the corrupt bureaucracy.</p>

<p>We had two hours to wait in Petrograd, locked in one
of the waiting-rooms where we were at last given a hunk
of bread and a piece of cold meat. Then we were driven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
out to Schl&uuml;sselburg in a motor-car, arriving there in the
grey break of dawn and being conveyed by boat to the
grim red-brick fortress which rose from the lake.</p>

<p>Stepping from the boat on to the floating landing-stage
we were conducted by armed warders through the iron
gate and along innumerable stone corridors where, ever
and anon, we passed other warders&mdash;men who, criminals
themselves, spent their lives in the fortress and were never
allowed to land in order that they might not reveal the
terrible secrets of that modern Bastille. Those who would
form a proper opinion of our Empire should remember
that this horrible prison was at the disposal of each of the
Ministers and their sycophants, and that hundreds of
entirely innocent people of both sexes had for years been
sent there out of personal spite or jealousy, and also in the
furtherance of Germany's aims for the coming war.</p>

<p>Within those dark, gloomy walls, where many of the
dimly lit cells were below the lake, hundreds of patriotic
Russians had ended their lives, their only offence being
that they had been too true to their Emperor and their
own land!</p>

<p>Ever since my childhood I had been taught to regard
Schl&uuml;sselburg as an inferno&mdash;a place from which no victim
of our corrupt bureaucracy had ever emerged. Only His
Excellency the Governor and the under-Governor had for
years landed from that island fortress. To all others communication
with the outside world was strictly forbidden.
Hence I was fully aware that now I had set foot in the
hateful place my identity had become lost, and only death
was before me.</p>

<p>And such deeds were being done in the name of the
Tsar!</p>

<p>At the time I believed in His Majesty, feeling that he
was in ignorance of the truth. Nowadays I know that he
was, all the time, fully aware of the crimes committed in
his name. Hence, I have no sympathy with the Imperial
family, and have welcomed its well-deserved downfall.</p>

<p>Into a small room where sat an official in uniform I
was ushered, and later, after waiting an hour, was com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>pelled
to sign the big leather-bound register of prisoners.
Already my crime had evidently been written down in a
neat official hand, yet I was given no opportunity to
read it.</p>

<p>"Enough!" said the big bearded officer with a wave
of the hand. "Take him to his cell&mdash;number 326."</p>

<p>Whereupon the three men who had conveyed me there
bundled me down two steep flights of damp stone steps,
worn hollow by the tread of thousands of those who had
already gone down to their doom, into a corridor dimly
lit by oil-lamps&mdash;a passage into which no light of day ever
penetrated.</p>

<p>There we were met by an evil-looking ex-convict who
carried a key suspended by a chain.</p>

<p>"Three-two-six!" shouted one of my guardians,
whereupon the gaoler opened a door and I was thrust into
a narrow stone cell, the floor of which was an inch deep
in slime, faintly lit by a tiny aperture, heavily barred,
about ten feet above where I stood.</p>

<p>The door was locked behind me and I found myself
alone. I was in one of those oubliettes which at the will
of my captors could be flooded!</p>

<p>I held my breath and glanced around. Within me
arose a fierce resentment. I had acted honestly towards
my scoundrelly employers&mdash;though, be it said, my object
was one of patriotic observation&mdash;yet they had allowed me
to become the victim of the secret police who would, no
doubt, obtain great kudos, and probably a liberal <i>douceur</i>,
for having unearthed "a desperate plot against Her
Majesty the Empress!"</p>

<p>That there was a plot was quite true&mdash;but one unsuspected
by the Chief of Police of Kazan.</p>

<p>My paroxysm of anger I need not here describe.
Through the hours that passed I sat upon the stone seat
beside the board that served me as bed, gazing up at the
small barred window.</p>

<p><i>Clap&mdash;clap&mdash;clap</i> was the only sound that reached me&mdash;and
with failing heart I knew the noise to be that of
waves of the lake beating upon the wall within a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
inches of my window, the dark waters which in due time
would no doubt rise through my uneven floor and engulf
me. Big grey rats ran about in search of fragments of
food&mdash;of which there was none. I was a "political," and
my food would certainly not be plentiful.</p>

<p>In those awful nerve-racking hours, never knowing
when I might find my floor flooded as signal of a horrible
death, I paced my cell uttering the worst curses upon those
who had employed me, and vowed that if they gave me
the grace&mdash;for their own ends&mdash;to escape I would use
my utmost endeavours to destroy them.</p>

<p>I did not blame the Okhrana or the Chief of Police of
Kazan. They had both acted in good faith. Yet I remembered
that I was the catspaw of Kouropatkine and
of St&uuml;rmer, either of whom could easily order my release.
And that was what I awaited in patience, although in
terror.</p>

<p>Days went by&mdash;hopeless, interminable days. The
lapping of the waters above me ever reminded me of the
fate that had been of the many hundreds who had previously
occupied that same fearsome oubliette and had been
drowned, deliberately murdered by those into whose bad
graces they had fallen.</p>

<p>When the grey streak of light faded above me the
gruff criminal in charge would unbolt my door and bring
me a small paraffin lamp to provide me with light and
warmth for the night. When the lamp was brought each
night I thought of Marie Vietroff whose name was still
upon everyone's lips. The poor girl, arrested though innocent
as I had been, had been confined in a cell in the
fortress of Peter and Paul, and her fate was known in
consequence of certain revelations admitted by the Assistant
Public Prosecutor. This official, the tool of higher
and more corrupt officials, had admitted that the girl,
though entirely innocent of any crime, had been arrested
out of spite and sent to the fortress where, to escape a
doom more horrible than death itself, she had emptied
the oil from her lamp over herself while in bed, and then
set fire to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
Often, even in that deep oubliette, the sounds of
woman's shrieks reached me, and each time I thought of
the girl-victim of an official's revenge.</p>

<p>Days passed&mdash;so many that I lost count of them&mdash;until
I had abandoned hope. The scoundrels whom I had
served had forsaken me now that I had served their purpose.
Rasputin had fascinated the Empress by that
mesmeric glance of his, and it had probably been deemed
wiser that my mouth should be at once closed. At any
moment I might discover the water oozing up between
those green slime-covered stones.</p>

<p>One day, however, at about noon the gruff uncommunicative
peasant who was my gaoler&mdash;a man incarcerated
for murder in Moscow&mdash;unlocked the door and
bade me come out.</p>

<p>In surprise I was taken along the corridors to that
same small room in which I had put down my name in
that Book of Fate they called the Prison Register, and
there the same official informed me that it was desired
to interrogate me at the Ministry of the Interior in
Petrograd.</p>

<p>Another interrogation! My spirits rose. If my
captors meant to have the truth, then they should have it.
I would expose the plot, let me be believed or disbelieved.</p>

<p>Escorted by two agents of police, I was taken out
into the dazzling light of day back to Petrograd, and to
the Ministry of the Interior, where in a private room&mdash;one
that was in a wing of the great building familiar to
me&mdash;I was left alone.</p>

<p>I had only been there for a few minutes, looking out
of the window in wonder, when the door opened, and
before me stood the goat-bearded man Boris St&uuml;rmer.</p>

<p>"Welcome back, my dear Rajevski!" he exclaimed,
coming towards me and shaking my hand warmly. "We
only knew yesterday where you were. Those fools in
Kazan spirited you away, but that idiot the Chief of
Police has been to-day dismissed the service for his
meddling. I do hope you are none the worse for your
adventure," he added with concern.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
"Surely Grichka knew of my arrest!" I said. "Did
he not inquire?"</p>

<p>"He did not dare to do so openly, lest he himself
should be implicated," replied the German. "We were
compelled to wait and inquire with due judiciousness.
Even then we could not discover whither you had been
sent&mdash;not until yesterday. But it is all a mistake, my
dear Rajevski&mdash;all a mistake, and you must overlook it.
The Father is eagerly awaiting your return."</p>

<p>"I must first go home and exchange these dirty
clothes," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes. But first accept the apologies of the General
and myself. You, of course, knew that we should extricate
you&mdash;as we shall again, if any other untoward
circumstances happen to arise. Recollect that we can
open any door of prison or palace in Russia," and then
he smiled grimly as I took my leave.</p>

<p>I returned to my own rooms to find that they had,
during my absence, been searched by the police, and some
of my correspondence, of a private and family nature, had
been taken away. At this I felt greatly annoyed, and
resolved to obtain from Kouropatkine immunity from such
domiciliary visits in future.</p>

<p>Upon my table lay a letter which had, I was told,
arrived for me that morning. On opening it I found that
it was from the head office of the Azof-Don Commercial
Bank, in the Morskaya, officially informing me that a
sum of fifty thousand roubles had been placed to my credit
there by some person who remained anonymous.</p>

<p>The present was certainly a welcome one, made no
doubt as reparation for the inconvenience I had suffered.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later I arrived at the Poltavskaya where
old Anna admitted me, and I at once went to the monk's
sanctum.</p>

<p>Rasputin sprang from his chair and, seizing both my
hands, cried:</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear F&eacute;odor! So here you are back with
us! This relieves my mind greatly."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Back from the grave."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
"The infernal idiots!" declared the monk, his wide-open
eyes flashing as he spoke. "I will see that it does
not occur again. But you quite understand, F&eacute;odor, that
it was not wise to reveal that I had gone to Kazan on
purpose to pray in the Empress's presence."</p>

<p>I smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"Somebody has placed fifty thousand roubles to my
account at the Azof-Don Bank."</p>

<p>In turn the rascal smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"You need not seek its source. It is out of the
Government funds, and is yours. Keep a still tongue,
and there may be other payments." Then, turning to his
table, he showed me quantities of correspondence which
had been left unattended in my absence, and urged me
to get to work, adding: "I have to be at the Baroness
Tchelkounoff's this afternoon, and there is a s&eacute;ance here
to-morrow&mdash;five neophytes to be initiated."</p>

<p>So five more silly, neurotic and, of course, wealthy
women were to be initiated into the mysteries of the
mock saint's religion. Grichka had no use for those whose
pockets were not well lined, for he was accumulating vast
sums from those weak, fascinated females who believed
in his divinity as healer and spiritual guide.</p>

<p>Presently I seated myself at the table and recommenced
my secretarial duties, while he went forth. In many
letters were drafts for subscriptions for Rasputin's convent
in far-off Pokrovsky in Siberia, a place which no
one had ever visited, yet in support of which he had
obtained hundreds of thousands of roubles. I might
here state that later on, when I visited Pokrovsky, I
found the wonderful convent, of which he told me such
pious stories, consisted of a plain house cheaply furnished
in which lived his peasant wife and children, together
with twelve of his chosen sister-disciples, foolish women
who had made over their money to him and devoted their
lives to piety as set forth in his new "religion."</p>

<p>A fortnight passed. Of Kouropatkine we saw little.
He had, at last, assisted by the traitor St&ouml;ssel and at
Germany's instigation, succeeded in forcing war with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
Japan, and the streets of the capital were filled with
urging, enthusiastic crowds bent upon pulling the Mikado
from his throne.</p>

<p>Kouropatkine had, according to what Rasputin told
me, assured the Emperor that the victory would be an
easy one, and that the Japanese would fly at first sight
of our troops. The General had quite recently returned
from the Far East, and had presented a personal report
to the Tsar describing Japan's war preparations. He
had declared that if Russia meant victory she must strike
at once. Hence war was declared; you know with what
disastrous results to both the Army and Navy of Russia.</p>

<p>It was, however, on the day before the declaration
of war that Rasputin's real triumph came. The Empress,
who had been searching Russia high and low for the
pious Father beside whom she had knelt in Kazan, had
at last discovered him, and he received a command to
an audience at the Palace of Tsarskoe-Selo.</p>

<p>The monk, his eyes shining with glee, showed me the
letter from Count Fredericks, Minister of the Court, and
said: "You must accompany me, F&eacute;odor."</p>

<p>At noon on the day appointed we therefore left
Petrograd together. The monk wore, in pretended
humility, his oldest and most rusty robe&mdash;though beneath
it, be it said, his under garments were of silk of the finest
procurable in the capital&mdash;while suspended by a thin brass
chain around his neck was a cheap enamelled cross. He
was unkempt, unwashed, his face sallow and drawn, yet
those wonderful brilliant eyes stared forth with uncanny
intensity of expression. His hands were grimy, and his
long tapering finger-nails had not been cleaned for weeks.
Such was the man whom Alexandra Feodorovna, fascinated
by his glance, had called to her side.</p>

<p>On arrival at the station of Tsarskoe-Selo we found
one of the Imperial carriages awaiting us, with footman
and coachman in bright blue liveries, with outriders.</p>

<p>Two flunkeys, also in blue, advanced, and, placing
their hands beneath the saint's arms, lifted him into the
carriage, an honour always paid to those who are special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
guests of His Majesty the Tsar. As for myself I climbed
in afterwards, smiling within myself at the spectacle of
the unwashed monk being lifted in as though he were an
invalid. With us was an officer in uniform and a civilian&mdash;an
agent of the Okhrana.</p>

<p>The moment we had seated ourselves the Imperial
servants took off their cocked hats and replaced them
crosswise on their heads as sign that within the carriage
was a guest of His Majesty, and in order to signal to
passers-by as we drove along to remove their hats or
salute.</p>

<p>Rasputin had already been given instructions by
General Erchoff, Chief Procurator of the Holy Synod, as
to how we should act in the presence of Her Imperial
Majesty. We had both attended before him, Rasputin
well knowing that Erchoff was one of his most bitter
enemies, but who on account of the Tsaritza's interest
was now posing as a friend.</p>

<p>After our drive back to Rasputin's house the monk,
flinging himself into a chair and lighting a cigarette,
thoughtfully remarked:</p>

<p>"That puppet Erchoff will later on regret that he
denounced me a year ago. His term of office is at its
limit."</p>

<p>The mock saint was possessed of an almost supernatural
intuition. In everyday life he would tell me of
things that would happen socially and politically, and sure
enough they would happen. The gift of looking into the
future is given to a few men and women in the world,
those persons who sometimes when they look into the face
of another hold their breath and remain silent, because
they see death written upon the countenance before them.
This curious faculty was possessed by Rasputin to a very
marked degree&mdash;a faculty which has puzzled scientists
through all the ages, a faculty which usually runs side by
side with an overweening vanity and an amazing self-consciousness.
Sometimes the possessor of that most
astounding and mysterious intuition is also possessed of
a humble and retiring disposition. But it is seldom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
Grichka, as all Russia called him, was an outstanding
personality, clever, scheming, and as unscrupulous as
he was avaricious. His mujik blood betrayed itself
every hour.</p>

<p>Even as we sat there in the Imperial carriage as we
drove to the Palace, he smiled with self-conscious sarcasm
when the people saluted or doffed their hats to him as
an Imperial guest.</p>

<p>At last we arrived before huge prison-like gates,
which opened to allow us to pass, sentries saluted, the
doors swung back again, and we found ourselves in the
great well kept park of the Alexander Palace.</p>

<p>I saw two civilians walking together along the drive,
which led into a wood. They were agents of the secret
police patrolling the grounds, for every precaution was
being taken to guard the persons of Their Majesties. The
death of the girl Vietroff had aroused the indignation
of Russia to such an extent that the atmosphere was
charged with anarchism.</p>

<p>Our road lay through woods, past a model dairy.
Thence we went past two large farms, and out into open
meadow lands, everything being kept most spick-and-span
by the hundreds of servants.</p>

<p>The system of defence of Tsarskoe-Selo struck me as
amazingly well designed. The road we had driven along
seemed to be a maze, for twice we had left what appeared
to be the main road, and passing three guard-houses&mdash;small
fortresses in themselves, in case of an attack by
the revolutionists&mdash;we at last arrived before the main
entrance of the royal residence, guarded by a detachment
of fierce-looking Kubansky Cossacks. These were drawn
up standing at the salute, with their officers, as we
approached. It was surely a picturesque guard of honour,
with their quaint, old-fashioned pointed headgear, their
smart comic-opera tunics, and their long, shiny boots.</p>

<p>In a great high white wall is an elegant gate of
delicately wrought ironwork, with the usual striped
sentry boxes on either side. Around are seated Chinese
statues in bronze, each upon its pedestal. Over the gate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>way
is the Imperial cipher in bronze, and beyond in the
holy of holies is the long two-storied palace of Tsarskoe-Selo,
that spot forbidden to all save to the guests of Their
Majesties.</p>

<p>I give this in detail because few outsiders, very few
indeed&mdash;save ambassadors and other jackanapes in
uniform&mdash;had, until the arrest of the Romanoffs, ever
trod within the hallowed precincts of the palace-fortress,
the bomb-proof home of the incompetent weakling who
had been crowned Tsar of All the Russias.</p>

<p>As we passed through that last gate I saw before us
a building very much like a French ch&acirc;teau of the
sixteenth century, a long low building with sloping slated
roofs, few chimneys, and a clock&mdash;which, by the way,
had stopped&mdash;high over the entrance.</p>

<p>Everywhere since we had entered the Imperial domain
all was most scrupulously well kept. Not a gravel stone
was out of place. Gangs of men were, indeed, kept
to rake over instantly the gravel drives so as to obliterate
the track of the wheels of the carriages.</p>

<p>At last with due pomp we drew up before the long
portico of the comfortable but not imposing house in
which lived Their Imperial Majesties.</p>

<p>As we descended an attendant took Rasputin's staff,
when instantly there came forward a lieutenant of Cossacks,
a curiously crafty-looking fellow, who asked us
if we desired to wash, or wished for a drink or for food.</p>

<p>The fellow was repulsive, even to the charlatan himself.
The latter gazed at him, and replied in his deep,
serious tones:</p>

<p>"I am here to see our Empress. I have no need for
thy ministrations."</p>

<p>At this rebuke the evil-looking officer looked daggers,
and seeing that I was but a menial as secretary he did
not deign to address me.</p>

<p>A few seconds later we were taken in charge by the
"skorochodi," servants who are so intelligent that they
are nicknamed the "quick-walkers." The palace contains
hundreds of servants and hangers-on, but these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
are the ones picked to take visitors through the semicircular
built palace to audience of either the Tsar or his
spouse.</p>

<p>Through a long corridor we were conducted past the
doors of a number of rooms. At each were two sentries,
one a big Abyssinian negro in blue and gold&mdash;called an
"Araby" in the palace&mdash;and the other a stolid Cossack
sentry with his fixed bayonet.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor we were met by one of the
Emperor's personal servants who came forward in all
humility, and bowing before Rasputin, asked.</p>

<p>"Can I be of service, Father, before you have
audience?"</p>

<p>Both of us were surprised. Here, in the midst of all
the pomp and ceremony was an ordinary Russian peasant,
as unlettered and as uncouth as Rasputin himself, and a
personal attendant of his Majesty.</p>

<p>He ushered us into a pretty room, with a long balcony
upholstered in pale grey silk, with thick soft carpet to
match, an apartment which might have been the boudoir
of the Empress herself.</p>

<p>"I am here at Her Imperial Majesty's command," replied
the Father, ready for the crowning of the slow and
subtle plot which St&uuml;rmer had engineered with Kouropatkine.
"She desires to speak with me."</p>

<p>Next instant the servant, who no doubt knew of
Grichka's wonder-working with his mock miracles, threw
himself upon his knees, and craved:</p>

<p>"Oh, our Father, I beseech thee to place thy blessing
upon me, and upon my wife and my invalid child. The
doctor who came yesterday said that she is suffering from
phthisis, and that the case is serious. I beg of thee to
cure her."</p>

<p>"Thy name?" he asked quickly, looking straight into
his face with those wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>"Aivasoff&mdash;Ivan Aivasoff."</p>

<p>"Whence do you come?"</p>

<p>"From Ossa, in the Government of Perm."</p>

<p>"And you are His Majesty's valet, eh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
"I am one of His Imperial Majesty's valets. He
told me that the Tsaritza had commanded you here, and
that I was to introduce you and your secretary, F&eacute;odor
Rajevski."</p>

<p>Rasputin halted, and assuming his most pious demeanour&mdash;that
same attitude which had attracted Petrograd
society&mdash;and incidentally extracted hundreds of
thousands of roubles from its pockets&mdash;crossed his hands,
muttered some words, and bestowed his blessing upon
the Tsar's body servant.</p>

<p>A minute later the man Aivasoff straightened himself
and, pointing to a door on the opposite side of the
room, asked:</p>

<p>"Are you both ready? The Tsaritza is awaiting you."</p>

<p>Rasputin, though pretending to be careless of his
personal appearance, stroked his long beard, and then
announced his readiness to pass into the presence of
the Empress.</p>

<p>"You will go first, and bow," said our attendant.
"Your secretary will remain within the door with hands
crossed before him," he said.</p>

<p>Then with his knuckles he rapped thrice upon the
white enamelled door, and, turning the handle of the lock,
entered, walking before to announce us.</p>

<p>In front I saw a deep glow of electricity shaded with
daffodil silk, a pretty artistic room with high palms,
choice cut flowers, and soft luxurious couches upholstered
in grey and gold brocade. There sat two ladies, one
of whom was in a silk gown of bottle green, which was,
no doubt, the latest creation of the Rue de la Paix&mdash;the
Empress&mdash;while the other, who was in elegant
black, I afterwards recognised as her bosom friend who
had accompanied her to Kazan, Mademoiselle Z&eacute;neide
Kamensky.</p>

<p>Ivan Aivasoff bowed low as he uttered his stereotyped
words of introduction. He was one of those ignorant
persons with whom the unscrupulous bureaucrats had
surrounded the person of the Tsar. He was an honest,
well-meaning fellow from the Urals, who had been selected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
to pose as a palace official, and to act just as I was
acting, as the tool of others; a peasant chosen because
he would naturally be less affected by revolutionary and
progressive influence.</p>

<p>Aivasoff was, as I afterwards learnt, but one of many
peasants in immediate contact with the Emperor and
Empress, the other servants being German.</p>

<p>As we bowed before the two ladies they rose smiling,
while the Father with raised hands pronounced upon them
his blessing in that pious, slightly hoarse, but deeply
impressive voice of his. Then, after the Empress had
welcomed him he fixed her with that impelling, hypnotic
gaze of his, and in pretence of never having met her
before, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O Gracious Lady, I have come here at thy bidding,
though I am but a poor and unlettered wanderer, unfamiliar
with palaces. My sphere is in the houses of
the very poor in order to direct, to advise, and to succour
them. Such is God's will."</p>

<p>"Already, Father, we have heard of you," responded
the Empress, fascinated by the extraordinary thraldom of
his gaze. "Your great charitable works are well known
to us, as they are known through the length and breadth
of our Empire. It is said by many that you have been
sent unto us as saviour of Russia."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it is so, by God's Almighty grace," the mock
saint said, bowing low at the Empress's words, while
Mademoiselle Kamensky exchanged inquiring glances
with myself.</p>

<p>That scene was, indeed, a strange one, the dirty,
unkempt monk in his faded, ragged habit, greasy at
collar and sleeves, his black matted beard sweeping across
his chest, and his hair uncombed, standing erect and
rather imperious, posing as a Divine messenger, in that
luxurious private apartment of the Empress herself.</p>

<p>"It is but right that you, as our spiritual guide,
should be in direct touch with the Emperor and myself,"
she said, without, however, referring to the meeting at
Kazan, to which I had certainly expected she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
allude. "From our friend St&uuml;rmer I have learnt much
concerning your good works, Father, and I wish to
support them financially, if I may be permitted, just as
I did those of Father Gapon."</p>

<p>"Truly I thank thee, O Lady," he replied, bowing
low again. "My convent at Pokrovsky is in urgent need
of funds."</p>

<p>"Then I shall give orders for you to receive a donation
immediately," she said in a low voice, and with that
pronounced German accent which always reminded those
with whom she came into contact that she was not a
true-born Russian. "Stolypin, too, has told me of the
wonderful miracle you performed in Warsaw."</p>

<p>I knew of that miracle, an outrageous fraud which
had been perpetrated upon an assembly of ignorant
peasants by means of a clever conjuring trick in which
Rasputin's friend, the chemist Badmayev, and another,
had assisted. St&uuml;rmer had been laughing heartily over
it at Rasputin's house on the previous night.</p>

<p>"God hath given me strength," replied the monk
simply, and with much humbleness. "I am His servant,
sent by Him unto Russia as her guide and her deliverer.
As such I am before thee."</p>

<p>As he stood there with devout piety written upon his
sallow, shrunken countenance, he certainly presented a
most saintly, picturesque appearance, his attitude being
that of a most humble ascetic of the Middle Ages. Saint
Francis of Assisi could not have been humbler.</p>

<p>That Her Majesty was much impressed by the crafty
charlatan was quite apparent. In that strange jumble of
quotations from the Scriptures which he so often used,
he declared to her that by Divine command he intended
to guide Russia in her forthcoming progress and prosperity,
so that she should rise to become the all-powerful
nation of Europe.</p>

<p>"It is well, O Lady, that thou hast sent for me,"
he added. "I am thy most devoted servant. I am
entirely in thy hands."</p>

<p>And again crossing his begrimed hands upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
breast he raised his eyes to Heaven, and repeated his
blessing in that same jumbled jargon which he used at
the weekly s&eacute;ances of the sister-disciples.</p>

<p>"O Father, I sincerely thank you," replied Her
Majesty at last. "The Emperor is unfortunately away in
Moscow, but when he returns you must again come to us,
for I know he will welcome you warmly. We are both
striving for the national welfare, and if we receive your
goodwill we shall have no fear of failure."</p>

<p>"There are, alas! rumours of plots against the
dynasty," said Rasputin. "But, O Lady, I beg of thee
to heed these my words and remain calm and secure,
for although attempts may be made, desperate perhaps,
it is willed that none will be successful. God in His
grace is Protector of the House of Romanoff, to whom
a son will assuredly soon be born."</p>

<p>Alexandra Feodorovna held her breath at hearing those
words. That scene before the shrine of Our Lady of
Kazan was, no doubt, still vivid in her mind.</p>

<p>"Are you absolutely confident of that?" she asked
him in breathless suspense.</p>

<p>"The truth hath already been revealed unto me.
Therefore I know," was his reply. "I know&mdash;and I
here tell thee, O Lady. The Imperial House will have
a son and heir."</p>

<p>That prophecy, duly fulfilled as it was later on,
caused the Empress to regard the dissolute "saint" as
a "holy" man. In that eventful hour at Tsarskoe-Selo
the die was cast. The Empress had fallen irrevocably
beneath the spell of the amazing rascal, and the death-knell
of the Romanoffs as rulers had been sounded.</p>

<p>When we backed out of the Empress's presence the
peasant Ivan, who had introduced us, handed us over
to the Tsar's chief valet, an elderly grey-bearded man
in the Imperial livery, a man whose name we understood
was Tchernoff, and who had been valet of the old
Emperor Alexander III.</p>

<p>The Starets left the palace full of extreme satisfaction,
and indeed, when an hour later we were alone together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
in the train returning to Petrograd, he grinned evilly
across at me, and said meaningly:</p>

<p>"Alexandra Feodorovna did not forget our meeting
at Kazan, though she did not allude to it. Ere long,
though she is Empress, I intend that she shall sit at
my feet and do my bidding!"</p>

<p>And he chuckled within himself as was his peasant's
habit when mightily pleased.</p>

<p>Truly, that meeting with the Tsar's valet Tchernoff
was quite as fateful to Russia as the meeting with the
neurotic spiritualistic Empress herself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">the potsdam plot develops</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> a week after Rasputin's first audience of the
Empress Alexandra, the Bishop Theophanus, confessor of
the Imperial family, paid him a visit at the Poltavskaya.</p>

<p>The Bishop, a big, over-fed man, had a long chat
with the Starets in my presence.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty was very much impressed by you, my
dear Grichka," said the well-known cleric to the man
who, having pretended to abandon his profligate ways,
had parted his hair in the middle and become a pilgrim.
"She has daily spoken of you, and you are to be commanded
to audience with the Tsar. Hence I am here to
give you some advice."</p>

<p>The "holy" man grinned with satisfaction, knowing
how complete had been the success of St&uuml;rmer's plans.
At the moment Theophanus was in ignorance of the
deeply laid plot to draw the Empress beneath the spell
of the Starets whom the inferior classes all over Russia&mdash;as
well as the well-to-do&mdash;believed was leading such a
saint-like, ascetic life in imitation of Christ.</p>

<p>Truly, Grichka dressed the part well, and gave himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
the outward appearance of saintliness and godliness.
Even the Bishop was bamboozled by him, just as Petrograd
society was being mystified and electrified by the
rising of "the Divine Protector" of Russia.</p>

<p>Of his doctrine I need not here write. Dark hints
of its astonishing immorality have already leaked out to
the world through chattering women who were members
of the cult. My object here is to expose the most subtle
and ingenious plot which the world has known&mdash;the
Teutonic conspiracy against our Russian Empire.</p>

<p>Rasputin's "religion" was not a novel one, as is
generally supposed. It was simply a variation conceived
by his mystically-inclined mind upon the one devised by
Marcion in the early days of the Christian era. He
had conceived the theory that the only means by which
the spirit could be elevated was to mortify and destroy
the flesh.</p>

<p>The Bishop Teofan, or Theophanus, was a mock
ascetic, just as was Rasputin. Bishop Alexis of Kazan,
after Rasputin's visit there, had introduced him to the
Rector of the Religious Academy, and already the mock
saint had established a circle of ascetic students, of whom
Teofan and another Starets named Mitia the Blessed (a
name derived from Dmitry), who came from Montenegro,
were members. But Rasputin, although the leader, had
entirely imposed upon Teofan.</p>

<p>In all seriousness the Bishop told the Starets of the
interest in him which the Empress had aroused in the
mind of the Tsar.</p>

<p>"He is a keen spiritualist, just as is the Empress,"
said the confessor. "At Court everyone has heard of
your marvellous powers. I can promise you great success
if you carry out the views I will place before you. You
must form a Court circle of disciples. The woman most
likely to assist you is Madame Vyrubova, who, with
Mademoiselle Kamensky, is Her Majesty's greatest
confidante."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will meet her. You arrange it."</p>

<p>"To-morrow is Monday, and there will be the usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
clerical reception at the Countess Ignatieff's. I will see
that she is there to meet you."</p>

<p>"Excellent, my dear Teofan!" said the "saint." "In
this affair we will help each other. I will form a circle
of believers at Court, and Alexandra Feodorovna shall
be at their head."</p>

<p>The fact is that Teofan knew that Rasputin was
possessed of a marvellous hypnotic power, and, being
aware of the vogue of hypnotists at Court, saw in the
Starets an able assistant by whom to gain power in the
immediate entourage of Their Majesties. Thus, quite
unconsciously, he was furthering the plans of Kouropatkine
and St&uuml;rmer, who were receiving money from
Berlin.</p>

<p>Already one of Rasputin's principal disciples was
Madame Golovine, the elder sister of the Grand Duke
Paul's morganatic wife, Countess Hohenfelsen, a woman
who had become his most ardent follower, and who never
failed to attend, with her two daughters, the famous
s&eacute;ances held weekly in that big upstairs room.</p>

<p>On the following evening I went with Rasputin to the
great house of the Dowager Countess Ignatieff to attend
the usual Monday gathering of prelates and ascetics, for
her salon was a rendezvous for all kinds of religious
cranks, theologians, and people interested in pious
works. Rasputin's unexpected appearance there caused
a sensation.</p>

<p>Outside his circle of "disciples" he was unapproachable.
The instructions given me by Boris St&uuml;rmer were
absolute and precise. The reason that I was always at the
charlatan's right hand was because he could only write
with difficulty, and was therefore unable to make any
memoranda. His letters were the painful efforts of an
unlettered mujik, as indeed he was.</p>

<p>And yet already he had become the most renowned man
in the Russian capital!</p>

<p>Our Empire's quarrel with Japan had not been finally
settled. The country was in a state of serious unrest.
While the revolutionary spirit, started by the death of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
girl Vietroff, was seething everywhere, the dynasty was
threatened on every hand. Yet the ever-open eye of the
Okhrana was upon everyone, and arrests of innocent persons
were still continuing.</p>

<p>That night the salon of the Countess Ignatieff was
responsible for much concerning the downfall of the
Romanoffs. In the great luxurious drawing-room there
were assembled beneath the huge crystal electroliers a
curious, mixed company of the pious and the vicious of
the capital. There was the Metropolitan in his robes
and with his great crucifix, Ministers of State in uniforms
with decorations, Actual Privy Councillors and their
wives, and dozens of underlings in their gaudy tinsel,
prelates with crosses at their necks, and women of all
classes, from the highest aristocracy to the painted sister
of the higher demi-monde.</p>

<p>The gathering was characteristic of Petrograd in those
times of Russia's decadence, when Germany was preparing
for war. The fight with Japan had already been
engineered through Kouropatkine as a preliminary to the
betrayal and smashing of our Empire.</p>

<p>Of the conflict with the Mikado I have no concern.
My pen is taken up in order to reveal what I know regarding
the astounding plots conceived in Potsdam and
executed in Petrograd, in order fearlessly to expose those
who were traitors to their country, and to whom the
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> of 1917 was due.</p>

<p>In that great well-lit saloon, crowded by religious personages
of all kinds, the old Dowager Countess Ignatieff,
in stiff black silk, came forward to receive the popular
Starets as the newest star in Russia's religious firmament.
With St&uuml;rmer behind him to advise and to plot, aided by
an obscure civil servant named Protopopoff&mdash;who afterwards
became Minister of the Interior and a spy of Germany&mdash;the
"saint" never held himself cheap. That was
one of the secrets of his astounding career. Though he
possessed no education and could scarcely trace his own
name, he possessed the most acute brain of any lawyer or
banker in Petrograd. In every sense he was abnormal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
just as abnormal as Joan of Arc, Saint Anthony, Saint
Francis, or a dozen others who have been beatified.</p>

<p>The rheumatic old countess, after shaking hands with
us both, introduced us to a dozen other persons around
her. Suddenly she said:</p>

<p>"Ah! Here is my dear friend the Lady-of-the-Court
Anna Vyrubova. Allow me to introduce you, Father."</p>

<p>The Starets instantly crossed his hands piously over
his breast and bowed before a good-looking, sleek-faced
woman of forty, who was elegantly dressed, and who
greeted him with a humorous smile. Having heard much
of the woman's scandalous past, I naturally regarded her
with considerable curiosity. She was a woman of destiny.
Petrograd had not long before been agog with the scandal
following her marriage with a young naval officer, who
had gone to the Baltic, and unexpectedly returning to his
wife's room in the palace at Tsarskoe-Selo, had been shut
out by the Empress herself. The husband had afterwards
died in mysterious circumstances, which had been hushed
up by the police, and madame had remained as the personal
attendant upon Her Majesty with her inseparable
friend Z&eacute;neide Kamensky.</p>

<p>As I watched the monk's meeting with this woman of
adventure, I saw that he had at once fascinated her, just
as completely as he had hypnotised her Imperial mistress.
She stood before him, using her small black fan slowly,
for the room was overpoweringly hot, and began to chat,
assuring him that she had for a long time been desirous
of meeting him.</p>

<p>As I stood beside Rasputin I heard him say, in that
humble manner which always attracted society women:</p>

<p>"And, O Lady, I have heard of thee often. It is with
sincere pleasure that I gaze upon thy face and speak with
thee. It is God's will&mdash;let Him be thanked for this our
meeting."</p>

<p>The blasphemy of it all appalled me. I knew of certain
deep plots in progress, and I watched the handsome lady-in-waiting,
with whom the monk crossed the room, nodding
self-consciously to the bishops, prelates, and mock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>-pious
scoundrels of all sorts, with their female victims. I
held my breath in wonder.</p>

<p>As I followed I saw St&uuml;rmer, the goat-bearded traitor,
standing chatting to a pretty young girl in turquoise blue.
Then I overheard Madame Vyrubova say to the Starets:</p>

<p>"I came here to-night, Father, especially to meet you.
Her Majesty gave me a message. She is in despair. She
requires your help, prayers, and advice."</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear lady, I regret; I am fully alive to the
high honours which our Tsaritza has done me to command
me to Court. But my sphere is with the poor. My
life is with them&mdash;for their benefit and guidance."</p>

<p>"I bear you a message," said the well-preserved
woman of whom a thousand tongues had gossiped evilly
in Petrograd. "To-morrow the Empress expects you informally.
She will take no refusal."</p>

<p>"Refusal&mdash;how can I refuse my Empress?" he replied.
"I can beg of her to excuse me. I have to
attend a meeting in the lowest quarter of the city to-morrow
among those who await me. And in the evening
I go upon a pilgrimage. Her Majesty will not
begrudge the poor my ministrations. Please tell her
this. My sphere, as designed by God, is with the masses
and not in the Imperial Palace."</p>

<p>That was all I overheard. St&uuml;rmer called me aside
to whisper, and as he did so I saw that the Starets had
at once become surrounded by women, of whom he
always became the centre of attraction, with hands
crossed so humbly over his breast.</p>

<p>His refusal to go to Court was in accordance with
his extraordinary intuition and acumen, though his meeting
with the woman Vyrubova marked another milestone
in the history of Russia's betrayal.</p>

<p>The days passed. The world was, of course, in
ignorance, but we in the Poltavskaya, the monk and
myself, knew of the despatch of Admiral Rozhdestvensky's
blundering fleet on its voyage half-way round
the world, how he was ordered to fire upon anything he
saw in the North Sea, and how, as soon came out, he fired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
upon some of your British trawlers on the Dogger Bank,
for which our Government paid quite willingly sixty-five
thousand pounds in compensation.</p>

<p>But let the first war-chapter of Russia's history pass.
With it Rasputin had but little to do. The person who,
unwilling or not, carried out the will of Potsdam's Kaiser
was the Empress Alexandra. And having done so she,
with her curious nature, suddenly turned from gay to
grave. She became strange in her conduct and discarded
her wonderful Paris gowns&mdash;in which, by the way, she
was eclipsed by "Liane," the dark-haired diva of the
Paris <i>caf&eacute;s chantants</i>, in whom Nicholas II. took such a
very paternal interest.</p>

<p>Time after time I had been present when St&uuml;rmer and
Rasputin, chuckling over the undoubted success of their
conspiracy, discussed the situation.</p>

<p>Since Her Majesty had met the rascal monk at
Tsarskoe-Selo she had never appeared in public. On
certain occasions, when a Court pageant or function had
to be held according to custom and the calendar, it was
the Emperor's mother who, with her well-known charm
and honesty, received the guests. Excuses were made
for Alexandra Feodorovna's non-appearance. The truth
was that the Empress, full of spiritualistic beliefs, had
suddenly developed a religious mania, centred around the
amazing personality of the mock monk.</p>

<p>Thrice had Her Majesty sent him commands through
her pro-German puppet Fredericks, and thrice he, at
St&uuml;rmer's suggestion, refused to comply. This illiterate
Siberian monk, ex-horse-thief and betrayer of women,
actually disregarded the Imperial order! He had declared
himself to be the saviour of Russia, and greater
than the Romanoffs.</p>

<p>"The Empress is furious!" declared the Bishop
Teofan one day as, with his heavy bejewelled cross upon
his breast and wearing clothes of the richest texture, he
sat with the rascal in his den. "Sometimes she is in
anger, at others in despair. Anna Vyrubova is frantic.
Why do you not come to audience?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
"She promised that I should see Nicholas," was
the reply. "After I have spoken with him I will see
her. It does a woman good to wait."</p>

<p>"I agree, but your refusal may be stretched too far,"
said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"None will tell the truth concerning her," Rasputin
said. "I hear on one hand that she thinks herself too
fat and is taking the 'Entfettungscur' against the
advice of the Court physician. Others say that she has
eczema and dare not show her face, while others say she
is mad. What is the truth?"</p>

<p>"Come and ascertain for yourself."</p>

<p>"Her devotion is that of a fanatic&mdash;I take it?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. She lives only for the entertainment of
monks and pilgrims. You are lucky, my dear Grichka.
Madame Vyrubova was evidently entranced by you at
Countess Ignatieff's. She will do your bidding. Only,
I beg of you to come to Court."</p>

<p>The charlatan, however, steadily refused the Bishop's
advice. Instead, he left Petrograd that night alone, and
went away to his wife and sister-disciples at Pokrovsky,
in Siberia.</p>

<p>For more than two months he was absent from Petrograd.
One day a frantic message came to me over the
telephone from Madame Vyrubova, who inquired the
whereabouts of the Starets.</p>

<p>"The Father has gone to his convent at Pokrovsky,
Madame," I replied.</p>

<p>"What!" she gasped. "Gone to Siberia! Why,
Her Majesty is daily expecting him here at the Palace.
When will he return?"</p>

<p>"I regret, Madame, that I cannot say," was my
reply. "He has told me nothing."</p>

<p>"Will you please take a confidential message to Boris
St&uuml;rmer for me?" she asked. And when I replied in
the affirmative, she went on:</p>

<p>"Please go at once to him and ask him to come to
the Palace this evening without fail. I am very anxious
to see him concerning a highly important matter. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
carriage will meet the train which arrives at seven-thirty."</p>

<p>I promised to carry out the wishes of the Tsaritza's
favourite lady-in-waiting, and half an hour later called
upon St&uuml;rmer at his fine house in the Kirotshnaya, where
I delivered the message.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks I merely called at the
Poltavskaya each morning for the monk's letters, which
I opened and dealt with at my leisure.</p>

<p>His correspondence was truly amazing. The letters
were mostly from wealthy female devotees, missives
usually couched in pious language. Some contained
confessions of the most private nature, and asking the
Father's advice and blessing. All these latter he had
given me strict instructions carefully to preserve. Any
letter which contained self-condemnation by its writer,
or any confession of sin, was therefore carefully put
away, after being duly replied to. At the time, it did
not occur to me that the impostor ever intended to allow
them to see the light of day, and, indeed, it was not until
several years later that I discovered that he was using
them for the purpose of extracting large sums from
women who preferred to pay the blackmail he levied
rather than have their secrets exposed to their sweet-hearts
or husbands.</p>

<p>While Rasputin, having thrown off his cloak of piety,
was leading a dissolute life in far-off Pokrovsky, and
refusing to obey the Empress's repeated invitations, the
guns of Peter and Paul one day boomed forth salvo after
salvo, announcing to the world that the prayer uttered
by the Starets before our Lady of Kazan had been
granted.</p>

<p>An heir had been born to the Romanoffs!</p>

<p>There was but little public rejoicing, however, for
Russia was, at the moment, plunged into grief over the
disastrous result of her attack upon Japan. Nevertheless,
the event more than ever impressed upon the
neurotic Empress that Grichka was possessed of some
mysterious and divine influence. Her Majesty believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
entirely in his saintliness, and her faith in the power of
his prayers was complete. God had granted his prayer
and sent an heir to the Romanoffs because of his purity
and perfect piety. Already she was wondering whether,
in some mysterious way, the child's life was not linked
with that of the holy Father whom the Almighty had
sent to protect her son's existence.</p>

<p>Because of this the Empress sent to Rasputin, at
Pokrovsky, a number of telegrams, which eventually the
monk gave over to me to docket and put away with the
incriminating letters of his foolish and fascinated
admirers. The women of Russia, from the Empress to
the lowly superstitious peasant, were now at the charlatan's
feet.</p>

<p>One telegram from Alexandra Feodorovna read as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Father and Protector of our House, why do you refuse
to come and give us comfort? God has given the Romanoffs
an heir, and we desire your counsel and your prayers. Do,
I beg of you, return to sustain us with your presence. When
we met our conversation remained unfinished. I confess that
I doubted then, but I now believe. Make haste and come
at once to us. From your sister&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>."</p></div>

<p>Of this appeal the Starets took no notice. He preferred
the society of his sister-disciples at Pokrovsky to
that of the Tsaritza. Besides, was it not part of his
clever plan to place the Empress beneath his influence
by bringing her to the brink of despair? He had not yet
met Nicholas II., and it was his intention to place his
amazing and mysterious grip upon him also at the crucial
moment. So again the Empress sent him a communication&mdash;a
letter written in her own hand, and delivered by
one of the Imperial couriers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Why do you still hesitate?" she asked. "I sent you
word by Anna [Madame Vyrubova] that I desired eagerly to
see you again. Your good works are to-day in everyone's
mouth. All at Court are speaking of you and your beautiful
soul-inspiring religion, of which I am anxious to know more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
details from your own lips. It is too cruel of you to sever
yourself from Petrograd when all are longing for your
presence. What can I do in order to induce you to come?
Ask of me anything, and your wish shall be granted. Do
reply.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>."</p></div>

<p>Again he treated her invitation with contempt, for
following this, ten days later, she sent him another
telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If you still refuse to come I will send Anna to you to
try and induce you to reconsider the situation. Nicholas is
extremely anxious to consult you. Father, I again implore
you to come to us.&mdash;A."</p></div>

<p>Rasputin, who had created such a favourable impression
upon the lady-in-waiting Vyrubova, certainly had no
intention of allowing her to go to Pokrovsky and see
the sordid home which Russia believed to be a wonderful
"monastery," and to which Petrograd society had subscribed
so freely. He therefore sent Her Majesty a
message&mdash;the first response she extracted&mdash;to the effect
that he was leaving for Petrograd as soon as it was
possible to fulfil his Divine "call."</p>

<p>In the meantime I had been introduced by Boris
St&uuml;rmer, whom I met almost daily, to Stolypin, a friend
of Rasputin's principal disciple in Petrograd, Madame
Golovine, and to Monsieur Raeff, who afterwards, by
Rasputin's influence, received the appointment of Procurator
of the Holy Synod. At St&uuml;rmer's fine house there
were, in the absence of the Starets, constant meetings of
Raeff, General Kurloff, the Chief of the Political Police,
and a beetle-browed official named Kschessinski, who
was director of that secret department of State known as
"the Black Cabinet," a suite of rooms in the central
postal bureau in Petrograd, where one's correspondence
was daily under examination for the benefit of the corrupt
Ministers and their place-seeking underlings. In addition,
at these dinners, followed by the secret conferences,
there attended a certain smart, well-set-up officer named
Miassoyedeff, a colonel stationed at Wirballen on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
East Prussia frontier, and who had received gracious invitations
from the Kaiser to go shooting and to hob-nob
with him. This man afterwards became a spy of Germany,
as I will later on reveal.</p>

<p>Kurloff, as head of the Political Police, had, before
my appointment as secretary to the Starets, been my
superior, and therefore I well knew the wheels within
the wheels of his department. Naturally he was hand-in-glove
with the director of the Black Cabinet, the doings
of which would require a whole volume to themselves,
and to me it was evident that some further great and
deep laid plot was in progress, of which Rasputin was to
be the head director.</p>

<p>One day in the Nevski I met Mitia the Blessed, the
Starets who ran Rasputin so closely in the public favour.
I saw he was hopelessly intoxicated, and was being followed
by a crowd of jeering urchins. I did not, however,
know that St&uuml;rmer and his friends had arranged this disgraceful
exhibition of unholiness in order to discredit and
destroy Grichka's rival. Five minutes later I met the
Bishop Theophanus walking with the Procurator of the
Holy Synod, who, like myself, witnessed the degrading
sight, and from that moment Mitia the Blessed no
longer exercised power, and was not further invited to
the salons of those mystical members of the aristocracy.
He had been swept into oblivion in a single day.</p>

<p>Rasputin at last returned, forced to do so by the determined
attitude of the Empress, who without doubt
was suffering from serious religious mania, as well as
an acute form of neurotic heart disease. The monk arrived
quite unexpectedly at the Poltavskaya, and rang me up
on the telephone late one evening.</p>

<p>The Bishop Theophanus was, I found, with him. He
knew of his arrival, and had come from Peterhof to meet
him and urge him to go next day and see the Empress.</p>

<p>"If it is thy wish, I will," replied the "saint" with
some reluctance, for he knew too well that already he
wielded an unbounded influence over the Tsaritza. The
fellow whose record was the worst imaginable, and whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
very nickname, "Rasputin," meant in Russian "the dissolute,"
was regarded by the Empress as possessed of
divine power, and as saviour of Russia and protector of
the Imperial family and its heir.</p>

<p>"I hear that Alexis, Bishop of Kazan, has turned your
enemy, and has written to the Holy Synod regarding your
questionable monastery at Pokrovsky," remarked Theophanus.
"It is very regrettable."</p>

<p>"Bah! my dear friend. I have no fear," declared the
man whose vanity was so overweening. "Soon you will
see that Nicholas himself will do my bidding. I shall
play the tune, and he will dance. All appointments will,
ere long, be in my hands, and I will place one of our
friends as Procurator of the Holy Synod."</p>

<p>At the moment I was inclined to laugh at such bombastic
assertion. Little, indeed, did I dream that within
twelve months his prophecy would be fulfilled, and that
the ex-horse-stealer, whose secretary I had become, would
actually rule Russia through the lethargic weakling who
sat upon the throne as Tsar Nicholas II.</p>

<p>A week later I accompanied the Starets to have his
first audience with His Majesty the Emperor at the Palace
of Peterhof, that wonderful Imperial residence where the
great Samson Fountain in gilded bronze throws up from
the lion's jaws a thick jet seventy feet high, in imitation
of Versailles, and where nearly six hundred servants were
employed in various capacities. We passed the Marly
Pond, where the carp were called by the ringing of a bell,
and the Marly Cascade, where water runs over twenty
gilded marble steps. Truly, the beauties of Peterhof were
a revelation to the Starets and myself. On the previous
day he had had audience of the Empress at Tsarskoe-Selo,
but I had not been present, therefore I remained in
ignorance of what had transpired. All I know is that he
returned home and drank a whole bottle of champagne
to himself, in full satisfaction&mdash;not that he cared
for the wine, for his peasant taste favoured the fiery
vodka.</p>

<p>On entering Peterhof we were met by the valet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
Tchernoff, who greeted Rasputin very warmly with some
meaning words, and said:</p>

<p>"His Majesty is in his private cabinet expecting you.
Come."</p>

<p>Another valet took our hats and overcoats, and then
Tchernoff led us up a great flight of marble stairs, and
on through nearly a dozen panelled rooms with historic
portraits, much like those I had once passed through at
Fontainebleau, until he entered the blue drawing-room, a
great, old-fashioned, eighteenth-century apartment adorned
by a number of magnificent pictures by Saltzmann.</p>

<p>Your British public have never truly realised the gorgeousness
of the Palace at Peterhof, or the fact that in
the Imperial service at the various residences there were
no fewer than four thousand domestics, most of them useless
and all uniformed. The "Arabys," imported especially
from Abyssinia, and who wore fantastically embroidered
blue and gold uniforms with a great crimson sash, and a
kind of turban upon their heads, were simply well-paid
puppets, who added pomp to the gorgeous salons, the
doors of which they guarded.</p>

<p>As we passed through the great rooms on our way to
the Tsar's private cabinet, a hundred servants and
officials bowed to us, but Rasputin remained quite unimpressed.
He was possessed of a most astounding intuition,
and he knew that by his mystical practices, his mock
piety, and by apparently ignoring the Imperial pair that
success was assured.</p>

<p>At last we stood before the door of the autocrat's
room, which Tchernoff threw open unceremoniously, when
we were confronted by His Majesty, who wore a rough
tweed shooting-suit, presenting anything but an Imperial
figure. I had expected to see him in uniform, like the
thousand and one pictures which purport to represent
him, instead of which I found a very ordinary-looking,
bearded man, with deep-set eyes, a wan countenance, and
rather lank hair. He was square-built, a trifle below the
medium height, and a man whom, had you passed him in
the Nevski, you might have taken for a Jew tailor or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
small tradesman. But the room itself was a beautiful
one, like all the apartments in Peterhof, semicircular in
shape, with a great bay window looking out upon the
wonderful fountains, all of which were throwing up their
jets, with a great vista of greenery beyond.</p>

<p>The Tsar bowed as the Starets, crossing himself, bestowed
his blessing upon him. The owner of twenty
palaces and seven hundred million acres of land turned
his eyes to the carpet humbly as the mock saint uttered
those words of incomprehensible jargon which half Russia
believed to be inspired by the Divine will.</p>

<p>When Rasputin spoke His Majesty seemed cowed and
thoughtful. Over his whole frame was written fear and
exhaustion. His voice was hollow when he replied, and
his glance was full of anticipation. At every gesture of
the Starets he seemed startled.</p>

<p>Was it any wonder when one recollected, so many
were the plots against the dynasty, that at the moment
he had removed from Tsarskoe-Selo, where a gang of a
thousand men were engaged in digging deep trenches
around the palace because the Okhrana had got wind of a
desperate plot to tunnel beneath the Imperial residence
and blow it up together with its Imperial occupiers.</p>

<p>His Majesty addressed the Starets as "thee" and
"thou."</p>

<p>"I know, Father, that thou art our guide and
saviour," said the autocrat, when together we were seated
in the window, Rasputin explaining that he always took
me with him in order that I might take mental notes of
conversations and decisions.</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor is mute," he added. "And he is part of
myself."</p>

<p>Then His Majesty referred to Rasputin's "miracles"
which he had performed in Warsaw, Kiev, and other
places, mere conjuring tricks which had held the peasants
speechless in amazement.</p>

<p>"Theophanus has told us of them. Thou hast healed
the sick and cured the lame," said His Majesty. "Truly,
thou art greater in Russia than myself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
"Pardon, your Majesty," replied the impostor humbly,
"I am but God's messenger, but thou art Tsar. It is not
for me to exert authority, only to pray unceasingly for the
Empire and for the well-being of its Imperial House.
Theophanus hath, I hope, told thee that I seek no emoluments,
no advancement, no favour, no honour; I am but
the humble Starets&mdash;a pilgrim who hopes one day to see
Mount Athos, there to retire in devotion."</p>

<p>"Theophanus has told me much," said the Emperor.
"He has told me how at spiritualistic s&eacute;ances thou canst
work thy will with our departed, and how at the house
of our dear St&uuml;rmer not long ago thou didst obtain communication
with the spirit of my dear father Alexander.
Truly, thy powers are great, and we have need of thee.
Why didst thou refuse to come to us even though the
Empress sent thee so many commands?"</p>

<p>"Because, as I have replied to Her Majesty, I am no
courtier. My work lies in the homes of the poor, not in
the palaces."</p>

<p>"Ah, no," laughed the autocrat with good humour.
"Thou art truly sent to us to save Russia. Thy place is
here, in our own home."</p>

<p>I drew a long breath when I heard the Tsar pronounce
those words, for they showed quite plainly the
strong, invincible grip the impostor had, by posing with
unconcern, already obtained upon the Imperial family and
the Court.</p>

<p>The Starets crossed himself, and again bowed. I was
amazed to witness the crass ignorance and astounding
superstition displayed by the Emperor of Russia, whom
all Europe believed to be a progressive, wideawake
monarch. That he possessed a spiritualistic kink, as did
also his German wife, was quite apparent. Any bogus
medium or charlatan could easily impose upon him. A
dozen men and women who, by their vagaries and pretended
powers, had brought psychic studies into ridicule,
had given s&eacute;ances before the Emperor, and had told him
things which his crafty entourage had already paid them
to "reveal."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
On the night of the declaration of war with Japan,
Kouropatkine brought to Peterhof the French medium
Jules Verrier, who received a handsome fee for pretending
to get into touch with the spirit of Peter the Great,
who declared that Russia, in declaring war, had carried
out his wishes. And Nicholas was at once in high glee,
and mightily enthusiastic to know that his historic ancestor
approved of his action.</p>

<p>The Imperial Court was full of frauds, traitors, and
sycophants. In all of them Nicholas had the fullest confidence,
while his wife was possessed of certain knowledge
which sometimes caused her to discriminate.</p>

<p>The commonplace-looking man in tweeds, who was the
entire reverse of one's idea of an Emperor, grew confidential,
and it was plain that he was quite as much
impressed by Grichka as the Empress had been, for
throughout the audience the monk had used to the full
his inexplicable hypnotic power.</p>

<p>"Our good Theophanus and Helidor favour us with
their counsel, but, Father, thou hast our most complete
confidence. I beg of thee to grant the Empress another
interview to-morrow, for she is daily longing for counsel
from thee. I will fix the audience. So, as our friend,
please keep the appointment. But before we part I wish
to grant to thee any request that thou mayest desire&mdash;any
appointment or advancement of any friend. Speak,
and thy wish shall be at once granted."</p>

<p>The monk reflected. It was, indeed, the moment of
his first triumph.</p>

<p>"I have a young and extremely able friend named
Protopopoff in the Ministry of the Interior," he replied.
"He is a loyal son of Russia, and a pious believer. Cannot
he be advanced?"</p>

<p>"He shall be. I will make a note of the name," and
turning to his desk, he scribbled it upon the blotting-pad
with a stubby pencil, repeating the words:</p>

<p>"Protopopoff&mdash;in the Ministry of the Interior."</p>

<p>And such was the manner in which the man who was
the most audacious spy that Germany employed in Russia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
was placed in the path of advancement, subsequently in
1915 becoming Minister in his own Department, and betraying
his country for German gold.</p>

<p>Truly, the Potsdam plot was rapidly maturing, and
its amazing ramifications I intend to disclose.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">the murder of stolypin</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> a fortnight of the mock monk's audience of the
Tsar he found himself installed in a fine suite of rooms
in the Palace at Tsarskoe-Selo, one apartment being
assigned to myself as his secretary.</p>

<p>Rasputin's ascendancy over the Imperial couple became
daily more marked. I was the onlooker of a very
curious and clever game. Spiritualistic s&eacute;ances were held
frequently, at which the Emperor and Empress assisted.
In Petrograd the monk also continued the weekly receptions
of his "disciples," chief among them being Madame
Golovine and the Princess Paley. The Empress fell more
and more beneath the evil influence of the Starets, for she
felt convinced that his prayer had been answered by the
birth of an heir.</p>

<p>To one man&mdash;even though of the Germanophile party&mdash;the
intrusion of Rasputin into the Court circle caused
great annoyance. That was Count Fredericks.</p>

<p>Madame Vyrubova one day told me that the count
had that afternoon, in her presence, inquired of the
Emperor:</p>

<p>"Who is this new Starets of whom everybody is
talking?"</p>

<p>"Oh! merely a simple mujik whose prayers carry
right to Heaven," was His Majesty's answer. "He is
endowed with most sublime faith."</p>

<p>The count then warned the Tsar of the displeasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
which Rasputin's presence at Court was creating on every
hand, adding:</p>

<p>"There are rumours that he is a mere drunken libertine.
Make inquiries for yourself of his doings in Petrograd."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Count," laughed the Emperor carelessly,
"better one Starets than ten hysterics."</p>

<p>This seemed to me to prove that Rasputin's presence
often saved the Emperor from the hysterical outbursts of
his wife.</p>

<p>Indeed, only the previous day the monk put about a
story in Petrograd to account for the Empress's hysterical
state. He started a rumour that Her Majesty was,
against the advice of the Court physicians, following a
system of German <i>Entfettungscur</i>, or cure for obesity,
the result having been a complete breakdown of the
nervous system.</p>

<p>Thus, by slow degrees, the artful monk ingratiated
himself with the Imperial family, just as years ago, when
a mere cabdriver, in his pre-saintly days, he happened
to ingratiate himself with Alexis, Bishop of Kazan, who
became greatly struck with him, and later pushed him
forward as a holy man, yet for his trouble afterwards
found himself swept away, and his successor appointed
by Rasputin's own hand. The monk was relentless, overbearing,
suspicious of any persons who did him a favour,
and at the same time ready to lick the boots of Germany's
War Lord.</p>

<p>The "Dark Forces" were now strenuously at work.
Little did I enjoy the quiet of my own rooms in Petrograd.
My "saintly" master was ever active holding
conferences, often hourly, with Ministers of State, councillors,
and the "disciples" of his own secret cult.</p>

<p>Very soon I noted that his closest friend was Stolypin,
a good-looking man with beard and curled moustache,
who was President of the Council of Ministers.</p>

<p>At that period Stolypin and the Emperor were inseparable.
His Majesty gave him daily audiences, and
sometimes, through Mademoiselle Z&eacute;neide Kamensky, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
Empress's chief confidante, he had audience of Her
Majesty.</p>

<p>I met Stolypin often. His Excellency was a bluff but
elegant bureaucrat, who had succeeded Count Witte, a
man of refinement, belonging to a very old boyar family.
He was an excellent talker, and with his soft, engaging
manners he could, when he wished, exercise a personal
charm that always had a great effect upon his hearers.
His Excellency's great virtue in the Emperor's eyes was
that he never wearied him, and that was much in his
favour; he always curtailed his business. Whatever he
had to report to the Emperor was done quickly, without
unnecessary comment, and the conference ended, they
smoked together on terms of almost equality.</p>

<p>I beg the reader's pardon if I here digress for a
moment. After Stolypin we had a well-meaning statesman
as Prime Minister in Kokovtsov, who endeavoured
to follow the same lines as his master. He was a talented
and eloquent man, whom I often met, and who at first
impressed the Tsar by his crystallised reports. But
Emperor and Prime Minister had no personal attraction
towards each other, as they should have if an empire is
to progress. Nicholas never gave him his confidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may be permitted to reveal here a scene
historic in the history of the Empire, being present with my
master Rasputin in the Tsar's private cabinet. It was a
very curious incident, and revealed much concerning the
attitude of Nicholas towards the nation.</p>

<p>Kokovtsov, who had allowed Akimoff to be present&mdash;the
latter, I believe, in eager anticipation of a triumph&mdash;read
to the Emperor his new project for enlarging the
Government monopoly system for the sale of vodka. This
would have greatly increased the Government's exchequer,
but would inevitably have ruined the people.</p>

<p>In the room Rasputin sat in his black robe and his
big jewelled cross suspended by its chain, while I stood
beside him.</p>

<p>The Emperor, with a cigarette in his mouth, sat in a
big arm-chair at his desk, tracing circles and squares<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
upon a sheet of paper, his habit when distracted. Now
and then he scratched his head. He was attentive to the
report, still drawing his circles, but making no comment,
except that his lips relaxed in a faint smile.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned to Rasputin and asked: "Well
Father, what do you understand in all this?"</p>

<p>Kokovtsov ceased reading his project, and stood in
wonder. Not a single item of the project had been criticised,
no comment had been offered, therefore His Excellency
naturally believed that his efforts were receiving
approbation. Rasputin was silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Tsar rose from his chair with a sigh of
weariness, and slowly selected a fresh cigarette from the
big golden box upon his writing-table. Then he shook
hands with Kokovtsov as a sign that the audience was
at an end, and said:</p>

<p>"Really, my dear Excellency, I do not agree with your
project at all. It is all utter rubbish, and will only lead
the Empire into further difficulties. Surely Russia has
sufficient alcohol!"</p>

<p>I watched the scene with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>Poor Kokovtsov, so well meaning, bowed in assent
and crumpled up before the Tsar of all the Russias. The
blow was quite unexpected. When I left the Emperor's
presence with Rasputin, the latter said:</p>

<p>"Well, my dear F&eacute;odor. The day of Kokovtsov is
ended. One may be thankful for it, because it will mean
less friction between the Emperor and the Empress."</p>

<p>Three days later His Majesty dismissed his Prime
Minister, but gave him the title of Count. He had no
son, therefore the distinction was a mere empty one.</p>

<p>With this digression, for which I hope I may be
pardoned, I will return to Stolypin. The mystery of his
assassination has always been carefully hushed-up by the
Secret Police, but I here intend to lift the veil, and, at
the risk of producing certain damning evidence, disclose
the whole of the amazing and dastardly plot.</p>

<p>Few people know of it. Rasputin knew it, I know
it, the Empress knows it, and a certain woman living in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
seclusion in London to-day knows it. But to the world
the truth which I here write will, I venture to believe,
come as a great surprise.</p>

<p>The cry "Land and Liberty" was being heard on every
hand in the Empire. Peter Arkadievitch Stolypin, son
of an aide-de-camp general of Alexander II., was in the
zenith of his popularity. He had become a <i>vermentchik</i>,
the traditional appellation applied to the favourite of the
Emperor, and as such he loomed largely in the eyes of
Europe. He had entered the public service as a youth,
and had later on become governor of the province of
Samara, where he had attracted the notice of Count Witte
because of the drastic way in which he had suppressed
some serious riots there. In due course he was called to
Petrograd, where he was introduced to the Emperor, and
later on the mantle of Count Witte had fallen upon him.</p>

<p>Though in high favour with the Emperor he was clever
enough to court the good graces of Rasputin, knowing
full well what supreme influence he wielded over the
Imperial couple. For that reason I frequently had conversation
with him both at Court and at the Poltavskaya.
He was a man of complex nature. A lady-killer of the
most elegant type, refined and determined, yet lurking
in the corners of his nature was a tyrannical trait and a
hardness of heart.</p>

<p>In Samara he had distinguished himself by various injustices
to the population, and hundreds of innocent
persons had, because they had been denounced by the
<i>agents-provocateurs</i> of the secret police, been sent to
prison or to Siberia by administrative order. At first
there was a rivalry between him and General Trepoff in
the Tsar's good graces, but Trepoff died, leaving Stolypin
master of the situation.</p>

<p>Though Rasputin behaved graciously towards him
and often dined at his table, he was in secret his enemy.
So cleverly did the monk form and carry out his plot
that to the last he never believed but that the holy man,
who prayed so fervently for his success in the guidance
of Russia, was his most devoted friend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
Many crimes have been committed in Russia beneath
the shadow of the Black Wings, but perhaps none more
ingenious than the one under notice.</p>

<p>The first I knew of the deep conspiracy was in the
spring of 1911, by the visit one night to Rasputin's house
in the Poltavskaya of a tall, fair-haired man named Hardt,
whom I knew as a frequent visitor to the monk. He was
a merchant in Petrograd and a man of considerable means,
but, as I afterwards discovered, was an agent of Potsdam
specially sent to Russia as the secret factotum of the
Tsaritza. He was ever at her beck and call, and was the instrument
by which she exchanged confidential correspondence
with the Kaiser and other persons in Germany.</p>

<p>On that evening when Hardt called quite half-a-dozen
of the sister-disciples were taking tea with the saint and
gossiping, for each Thursday he would hold informal receptions,
and with horrible blasphemy bestow upon the
society women who attended his accursed blessing. The
ladies there on that night were all of the most exclusive
circle in Petrograd.</p>

<p>On Hardt's arrival the reception was cut short after
he had whispered some words to the Starets, who made
excuse that he had to leave to return to the palace.</p>

<p>Indeed, he went to the telephone at the farther end
of the room and held a conversation with the Tsaritza's
confidante, Mademoiselle Kamensky. None knew, however,
that that private telephone by which the charlatan
so impressed his visitors was merely a fake one, its
wires not extending farther than the end of the garden.</p>

<p>Grichka sometimes when alone rehearsed those conversations,
until he succeeded in producing a perfect series
of answers which would strike the hearer as a most
intimate conversation concerning either Emperor or
Empress.</p>

<p>From the chatter upon the mock telephone the
assembly concluded that his presence was required at the
palace immediately, therefore they rose and retired, leaving
the mysterious Hardt alone with us.</p>

<p>Instead of going to Tsarskoe-Selo we retired to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
saint's little den, where we opened a bottle of champagne,
of which we all three drank.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend Hardt?" asked the monk, flinging
himself carelessly into his easy chair and unbuttoning his
long black coat for comfort. "What has happened?
You can, as you know, speak before our faithful F&eacute;odor,"
he added.</p>

<p>"I have waiting outside a young woman whom I want
you to see," replied the German agent.</p>

<p>"Does she wish to enter our circle?" inquired the
monk, adding with his usual avariciousness: "Has she
money?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;neither," was Hardt's reply. "She does not
want to become one of your disciples; indeed, the less
you say on that matter the better!"</p>

<p>"Then why should I trouble to see her?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you all after you have chatted with her. May
F&eacute;odor invite her in? She is sitting in a droshky outside."</p>

<p>"If you wish," growled Rasputin. "But why all this
mystery? I have much to do. I am due at Countess
Ignatieff's&mdash;and am already late."</p>

<p>"Remain patient, I beg of you, Father," urged the
German suavely. "I am acting upon instructions&mdash;from
Number Seventy."</p>

<p>"From Number Seventy!" echoed the monk, instantly
realising that Hardt, an agent of the German
Secret Service, was carrying out some well-concealed and
ingenious project. "Very well," he said. "I rely upon
you not to delay me longer than necessary. F&eacute;odor," he
added, turning to me with that lofty air which his low
mujik mind sometimes conceived to be superiority, "go
and find this mysterious young person."</p>

<p>A few minutes later I conducted into the saint's presence
a dark-haired, extremely handsome young woman
of about thirty, who spoke with considerable refinement
and whose arrival mystified me greatly.</p>

<p>Hardt introduced her to the holy man, saying:</p>

<p>"This is Mademoiselle Vera Baltz, of Stavropol, a
friend of His Excellency Peter Stolypin."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
"Ah! Welcome, my dear mademoiselle," exclaimed
the monk affably. "So you are a friend of His Excellency&mdash;when
he was Governor of Samara, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have come here because I crave your assistance.
Monsieur Hardt knows all the circumstances, and
will explain."</p>

<p>The saint turned to the fair-haired man seated opposite
him, Mademoiselle Baltz having been given an easy-chair
close by Rasputin's table. It was a writing-table,
but the scoundrel never wrote. Sometimes he pretended
to do so, but the truth was that it was a long and painful
procedure with him. He preferred to scrawl his initials
to any typewritten letter which I prepared.</p>

<p>"The explanation is briefly this, Father," said Hardt
in his businesslike way. "Mademoiselle has been the
dupe of His Excellency, who, while Governor, often went
to Stavropol, where he stayed at an hotel under another
name. Mademoiselle never knew his identity until a year
ago, when she saw his photograph in the papers as Prime
Minister. She never knew that he was married&mdash;though
I have here a letter in which he proposes marriage to
her."</p>

<p>And he produced from his pocket a note, bearing the
heading of the Centralnaya Hotel at Samara, which
Rasputin read through.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the Starets, blowing a cloud of
cigarette smoke from his bearded lips.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is anxious to meet His Excellency."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," exclaimed the monk, whose mind at
once turned to blackmail, a course which he himself was
actively pursuing. "Mademoiselle wishes for money&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No, Father," replied the young woman stoutly. "Not
money&mdash;only justice! Peter Stolypin misled me, as you
see according to his letter. I am but one of his many
victims, and I desire to expose him."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted Rasputin, who, having ascertained
that no monetary consideration was forthcoming, was
not particularly interested in the affair. He never did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
anything without reward. Those who could pay him well
obtained through his influence at Court high office and
big emoluments. Within my own knowledge in at least
twenty cases he was already receiving heavy percentages
upon the salaries, including those of two bishops and
three under-secretaries, who had been dug out from nowhere
and pitchforked into office by him.</p>

<p>By his influence with Nicholas the rascal ruled Russia
with a relentless recklessness unparalleled in all history.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle has already had audience of Her
Majesty, who has sent her here to interview you," Hardt
explained. "I am placing her case in the hands of our
friend Altschiller."</p>

<p>The latter was a well-known lawyer, who, by the way,
was afterwards proved to be a spy of Austria.</p>

<p>"What do you desire of me, my dear young lady?"
asked Rasputin in the paternal manner he so often
assumed towards the fair sex who hung about the hem of
his ragged robe, and knelt so constantly before him for
his blessing.</p>

<p>"You, Father, are all-powerful in Russia," replied
Vera Baltz. "Her Majesty told me that you would help
me to&mdash;to destroy Stolypin," she said with a fierce expression
in her black eyes.</p>

<p>Rasputin exchanged glances with the secret agent of
Potsdam who, I knew, did so much dirty work on the
Empress's behalf.</p>

<p>"What Her Majesty desires, I am here to obey," was
the monk's quiet response. "I pray that no injustice be
done," the blasphemer added, piously crossing himself.</p>

<p>"Injustice!" cried the girl angrily. "He deceived
me, and left me to starve when he received his advancement
and came here to Petrograd. He became the Tsar's
favourite because of his cruel and harsh treatment of our
poor people of Samara, and has climbed to office over the
bodies of those shot down in the streets at his orders.
Injustice! There is assuredly no injustice to drag the
ghastly truth concerning him into the light of day."</p>

<p>"Not at all! I quite agree," said Rasputin, rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
and shaking her hand. "You can tell your lawyer from me
that you have my assistance, but in strictest secrecy, of
course. Not a soul must know of it, remember!" he
added, looking straight at her with that strange hypnotic
glance of his, a gaze beneath which she quivered visibly.</p>

<p>"I shall remain silent," she promised.</p>

<p>"If the truth leaks out that you have seen either Her
Majesty or myself, then I shall instantly become your
enemy, and not your friend," the monk declared.</p>

<p>"Only Monsieur Hardt knows," the girl said. "It
was he who took me to Peterhof."</p>

<p>"You may rely upon the silence of both my friends,"
Rasputin assured her, and a moment later I conducted
her downstairs and out into the street.</p>

<p>When I returned to where Rasputin was still seated
with his visitor, the latter was, I found, making explanation
how he had, after considerable difficulty, traced the
woman Baltz at the Empress's orders and taken her to
the Palace, first, however, prompting her to seek revenge
upon the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it at all," Hardt added.</p>

<p>"I do. Cannot you see that Stolypin is violently anti-German
and openly disapproves of the Germanophile
party at Court?"</p>

<p>"But he is closeted daily with the Emperor, I understand.
And the Empress grants him frequent audiences."</p>

<p>"Because she is endeavouring to ascertain the true
extent of His Excellency's knowledge of her own dealings
with our friends in Berlin," was the monk's reply. "Alix
pretends to be most gracious to him, yet she is distinctly
antagonistic, more from fear than anything else. To-day
he is a favourite at Court, to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Grichka made a wide sweep with his dirty
knotted hand without concluding his sentence.</p>

<p>"Has Her Majesty spoken to you concerning her fears
that Stolypin has discovered something?" asked the
man Hardt eagerly.</p>

<p>The monk grinned meaningly.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty is taking precautions," he replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
evasively. "Possibly Stolypin has discovered the reason
you travelled to Berlin a month ago. I have an idea that
you were watched by the Okhrana."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" gasped the German in
quick apprehension. "Why do you suspect?"</p>

<p>"From something whispered to me a week ago."</p>

<p>"Then Stolypin may know that Alexandra Feodorovna
is behind the traitorous dealings of Colonel Miassoyedeff
on the frontier&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Rasputin, his eyes fixed upon his visitor, slowly nodded
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"That means ruin&mdash;perhaps imprisonment for me!"
Hardt gasped, his face pale and anxious.</p>

<p>"I might say the same thing," remarked the saint,
stroking his long, untrimmed beard. "But I do not. We
are both strong enough to resist all attacks. Any suspicion
against Miassoyedeff must be removed. I will see
that the Emperor promotes him to-morrow. Our one
stumbling-block is Peter Stolypin."</p>

<p>"One that, I take it, must be removed?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at all costs. That is why the Empress has
sought out this woman Baltz, who, if my estimate of her
sex is correct, is a wild firebrand."</p>

<p>"She certainly is viciously vindictive."</p>

<p>"One thing is certain, our friend Stolypin has no idea
that he is seated on the edge of a volcano," remarked the
monk. "He lives extremely happily with his wife and
children in that beautiful villa over on the Islands of the
Apothecaries, and has no suspicion of the coming storm.
I promised his wife to go to her salon to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"And will you go?"</p>

<p>"Of course. There must be no suspicion. Are we
not, all of us, his best friends?" asked the monk, grinning
evilly.</p>

<p>"I am returning to Berlin by way of Stockholm on
Thursday," Hardt said, for he gave as the reason for his
frequent visits to Germany and Scandinavia that he bought
leather in those countries. "Have you anything to
report?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
"Yes. One or two things," replied the Starets, who
ordered me to write at his dictation as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>"<span class="smcap">Memorandum.</span></h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">From Gregory to Number Seventy.</span></p>

<p>"Have acted upon your instructions regarding the
Kahovsky affair. Some important correspondence was seized
by the police at his arrest, and for two days matters looked
extremely unpromising. I paid T. twenty thousand roubles
to close his lips, and induced the Emperor to release
Kahovsky and restore his papers. I suggest that he should
be recalled from Russia and sent to London, where, being
unknown, he might be extremely useful to you.</p>

<p>"Madame Zlobine is at the Adlon Hotel in your city.
She has quarrelled with the General, and strict watch should
be kept upon her. She has been heard to express very
decided views against Her Majesty. It may be found that
she is in communication with J. If so, it is in the interests
of Stolypin's anti-German campaign!</p>

<p>"Hardt will explain verbally the position of the latter,
and the discovery of the woman Baltz. Meanwhile His
Excellency is unsuspicious that we are aware of his hostile
intentions towards us.</p>

<p>"Please do me the favour to assure His Majesty the
Emperor of my continued efforts in the service of Alexandra
Feodorovna, even though matters are daily growing more
complicated. Anna [Madame Vyrubova], moreover, is more
difficult to please.</p>

<p>"Both St&uuml;rmer and Protopopoff are under my protection,
and I have already contrived to advance them. Kokovtsov
is growing in favour and will be a force to be reckoned with
in the immediate future. Urge Miassoyedeff, from your side,
to exercise the greatest caution. There are whispers, but I
have endeavoured to stifle them by contriving his advancement
through the Emperor, who yesterday decorated him.</p>

<p>"The Imperial pair will shortly visit the Danish and
Swedish Courts, and probably go for a cruise in Norwegian
waters, though there is, as yet, no announcement.</p>

<p>"I am still working upon the project you set out when
we met in Helsingfors two months ago regarding the reduction
and weakening of the army. I have already initiated
the matter through ladies whose husbands are in the Ministry
of War. It will mean the expenditure of a considerable sum
of your money, but I know it will be a mere bagatelle if your
object is accomplished.</p>

<p>"I have to acknowledge a payment of one hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
thousand roubles into the Azof Bank from an unknown
source. Please remember that S. in Paris and J. in Rome
are making big claims upon me, and that next month I must
receive a similar sum.</p>

<p>"Hardt has told me that matters are progressing well at
Carlton House Terrace, and also in Paris. Of that I am glad
to hear. Let our next meeting be at the Ph&oelig;nix Hotel in
Abo, where I am unknown, and which you can reach without
notice. At present I dare not leave Russia, as Her Majesty
will not hear of it.</p>

<p>"It would be as well to make the next payment through
the Aktiebank in Abo. They would not suspect.</p>

<p>"Do not fail to impress upon both Sukhomlinoff and
Miassoyedeff the necessity for the utmost caution. Till we
meet."</p></div>

<p>When I had typed this at his dictation I handed it to
him, and he managed painfully to append his illiterate
signature.</p>

<p>Then I placed the sheets in an envelope and gave them
to Hardt to convey in secret to the headquarters of the
German Secret Service in the K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzerstrasse in
Berlin.</p>

<p>"And, friend Hardt," Rasputin said, as the Kaiser's
emissary placed the letter carefully in his wallet, "please
impress upon Number Seventy what I have said about
money. All this costs much. Tell him that sometimes
when inordinate demands are made upon me&mdash;as you
know they are often are&mdash;I have to use my own funds
in order to satisfy them. Smith in London receives unlimited
funds through the Deutsche Bank, I know, so
please tell our friend from me that I expect similar treatment
in future."</p>

<p>The Starets was one of the most far-seeing and mercenary
scoundrels. He had accounts in different names
in half-a-dozen banks in Petrograd and Moscow, into
which he constantly made payments as the result of his
widespread campaign of espionage and the blackmailing
of silly women who fell beneath his uncanny spell.</p>

<p>When Hardt had left, the saint opened another bottle
of champagne and drank it all from a tumbler, afterwards
consuming half a bottle of brandy. I was busy with three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
days' accumulation of letters, and did not notice it until, an
hour later, I found him dead asleep on the floor of the
dining-room&mdash;a pretty spectacle if presented to the millions
of our patriotic Russians who believed in the Tsar
as their "Father" and in the divinity of the "holy man"
who directed the Empire's affairs.</p>

<p>The saint filled me with increasing disgust, yet I confess
I had become fascinated by the widespread and
desperate conspiracies which he either engineered himself
or of which he pulled the most important strings.</p>

<p>In the plot against Stolypin, though none dreamed of
it, he had been the most active agent. Stolypin, a purely
honest and loyal Russian, who, on taking office as Prime
Minister, was actuated by a firm determination to do his
level best for the Empire, was an unwanted statesman.
He was too honest, and, therefore, dangerous to the
Court camarilla set up and paid by Potsdam.</p>

<p>As the days passed the monk frequently referred to
him as a thorn in the side of the Empress.</p>

<p>"The fellow must be got rid <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'off'">of</ins>!" he declared to me
more than once. "He suspects a lot, and he knows too
much. He is dangerous to us, F&eacute;odor&mdash;very dangerous!"</p>

<p>One night, when we were together in his room at
Tsarskoe-Selo, after he had been dining <i>en famille</i> with
the Imperial family, he remarked:</p>

<p>"Things are going well. I saw the lawyer Altschiller
to-day. All is prepared for the coup against Stolypin,
who is still ignorant that Vera Baltz is in Petrograd."</p>

<p>I knew Altschiller, who often called at the Poltavskaya.
He was a close friend of Monsieur Raeff, whom Rasputin,
when all-powerful a little later on, actually appointed as
Procurator of the Holy Synod, having placed the appointment
upon the Emperor's desk to sign!</p>

<p>The law case was, however, delayed. Hardt was on
one of his frequent absences&mdash;in Germany, no doubt&mdash;and
matters did not move so rapidly as to satisfy the Empress.
The whole plot was to keep the Prime Minister in the
dark until the moment when the skeleton of his past
should be dragged from its cupboard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
As announced by Rasputin, the Emperor and Empress
had visited Denmark and Norway on board the <i>Standart</i>,
and were back again at Peterhof, when one day Rasputin
received his friend Boris St&uuml;rmer, the bureaucrat, at that
time struggling strenuously for advancement. In the
monk's den St&uuml;rmer, chatting about Stolypin and the vindictive
woman who had come to Petrograd to destroy
him&mdash;for he was one of the paid servants of Potsdam, and
in consequence knew most of the secrets&mdash;said:</p>

<p>"Have you, Father, ever met a Jew named Bagrov?"</p>

<p>"Never to my knowledge. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I know from my friend Venikoff, one of the
assistant-directors of Secret Police, that the man, a discharged
<i>agent-provocateur</i> and incensed at the way he has
been treated by Stolypin, has joined forces with some
mysterious young woman named Baltz. There is a
whisper that between them they are engineering a plot to
assassinate the Prime Minister!"</p>

<p>Rasputin's strange eyes met mine. Both of us knew
more than this struggling sycophant.</p>

<p>"Bagrov?" the saint repeated. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh! A fellow who was assistant to Azeff in some
disgraceful matters in Warsaw&mdash;an <i>agent-provocateur</i>
who lived afterwards for some time in Paris and on the
Riviera. He attributes his downfall to Stolypin, and
hence is most bitter against him. He has, I hear, fallen
in love with the woman Baltz, who hails from Samara."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the saint.</p>

<p>"Well?&mdash;nothing," laughed the man with the goat-beard.
"I simply tell you what I know. There is a
plot&mdash;that is all! And as far as I can discern the swifter
Stolypin leaves the Court, the easier it will be for Her
Majesty and ourselves&mdash;eh? While Stolypin is daily with
the Emperor there is hourly danger for us."</p>

<p>"In that I certainly agree," declared Rasputin. "We
must be watchful&mdash;very watchful."</p>

<p>We remained alert&mdash;all of us. That same night Rasputin
informed the Empress of the secret plot of the
black-haired Vera and her lover Bagrov.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
The Court left for the Crimea next day, and Rasputin
travelled with the Imperial family. Stolypin, in ignorance
of what was in progress, was of the party, I being left
in Petrograd to follow three days later.</p>

<p>On arrival at Kiev, where the Emperor had arranged
to review the troops, a gala performance was held in the
theatre that night. Opposite the Imperial box sat Stolypin,
with two other high officials of the Court, when,
during the entr'acte, a man dashed in, and in full view of
the Emperor and Empress fired a revolver at the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>The confusion this caused was terrible. Her Majesty
fainted and was dragged out of the box by Mademoiselle
Kamensky, while the Tsar swiftly jumped to his feet and
regarded the scene calmly.</p>

<p>"I'm done!" gasped the patriotic and honest Stolypin,
as those present seized the assassin, who was none
other than the ex-<i>agent-provocateur</i> Bagrov.</p>

<p>Six hours later the Prime Minister breathed his last,
a victim of the Empress and her Potsdam camarilla, while
Vera Baltz fled to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Rasputin afterwards told me that he urged the Court
to leave Kiev at once, adding:</p>

<p>"It was far best for Alix and Nicholas to pretend
horror of the tragedy than to offer condolences."</p>

<p>And so ended another chapter of Russia's underground
history.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">the power behind the throne</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> murder of Stolypin, though unsuspected by the
chancelleries of Europe, was, as I have explained, the
work of the Hidden Hand of Germany. Stolypin had
suspected the true state of affairs at the Russian Court,
therefore the success of Germany in the coming war de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>pended
upon closing his mouth; so Potsdam, using the
erotic monk Rasputin as its catspaw, effected a coup
which had, alas! sad result to Holy Russia.</p>

<p>Stolypin was but one of many persons of both sexes
who, because they knew too much of Germany's secret
propaganda in Russia, fell victims in those constant conspiracies
whereby they were swept either into the net of
the corrupt police or into their graves.</p>

<p>As servant of the head of Russia's "Dark Forces"&mdash;as
Rasputin and Protopopoff were afterwards denounced
in the Duma&mdash;I was compelled to be ever at the saint's
elbow; hence I saw and heard much that was astounding.</p>

<p>One night, a few months after Stolypin's assassination,
we had been bidden to dinner by the great Polish
landowner Ivan Volkhovski, who had a beautiful villa
outside Petrograd. There I met a smart, middle-aged
Russian officer, who, over our champagne, declared to me
that things were growing critical in Europe over the
Balkan question, but that France and Russia were united
against any attack that Germany might secretly engineer.</p>

<p>"Then you think that war is really coming?" I asked
him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Think!" he echoed. "You are a cosmopolitan,
surely! Don't you know? Are you really blind?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am blind politically," I replied with a wink.
"I see that on all sides people are getting rich quickly
and receiving ironmongery&mdash;as I call the tin decorations
from the Sovereign&mdash;as reward for closing their eyes to
the true facts."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see that you are quite wideawake, my dear
Rajevski," said the officer, whose name was Colonel
Dubassoff. "Our friends here in Petrograd will continue
to remain asleep, for they have every incentive, thanks
to the great pro-German propaganda and the generous
distribution of German gold. To-day our enemies in
Berlin have their hands outstretched and clutching upon
Paris, New York, Rome and London, just as they have
here in Petrograd. War must come&mdash;depend upon it.
The English Lord Roberts has forecast it. He knows!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
"Then you believe that Germany is at work actively
arming in preparation for war?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly I do," replied the colonel. "Only
a month ago I was in London and afterwards in Paris.
In London the authorities are not so entirely asleep as
we are in Russia."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he spoke, I noticed that Rasputin, who
was in whispered conversation with Bishop Theophanus,
a fellow-guest, had been listening very attentively.</p>

<p>Two hours later, when I returned home with Rasputin,
he ordered me to sit down and write a note, which the
scoundrel dictated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Please listen to N.N. Colonel Paul Dubassoff, of the
Pr&eacute;obrajensky Regiment, has expressed in my presence to-night
disloyalty to the Sovereign, and he is a serious danger
to the State. He should be suppressed."</p></div>

<p>To this lie the monk scrawled his initials, and next
morning the letter was sent to the Chief of the Secret
Police. Within twelve hours the unfortunate colonel who
had dared to pronounce his opinion concerning Germany's
activities was already lodged in the fortress of Peter
and Paul, where, I believe, he remained until the Revolution
of 1917.</p>

<p>At that moment, however, the German propaganda in
Russia found itself in an extremely critical state. By
Stolypin's murder a new difficulty had arisen. All the
colleagues of the late Prime Minister believed themselves
entitled to become his successor, and as each had his own
particular circle of friends, each naturally pulled all the
political wires possible. Intrigues arose on every hand,
and though everybody realised the personal danger of
anybody appointed to the dead man's position, yet ambition
was apparent everywhere.</p>

<p>The Empress, who had now returned from her fateful
journey to the Crimea, was in daily consultation with
the monk, it being their intention to obtain the appointment
of some hard-up Minister who, by being well paid
with German gold, would remain inert and keep his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
mouth closed regarding the world-plot in progress.
Being at Tsarskoe-Selo, and conducting the Starets's correspondence,
I know how deep was the intrigue to keep
out and discredit the Minister of Finance, Vladimir
Nicholaievitch Kokovtsov, who was known to be the only
strong man who could succeed Stolypin.</p>

<p>The whole machinery of the pro-German propaganda
had been set to work from Berlin to prevent the mantle
of Stolypin falling upon Kokovtsov. Yet one afternoon,
while I sat writing at Rasputin's dictation in his elegant
sitting-room in the palace of Tsarskoe-Selo, the Empress,
who was dressed ready to go for her daily drive, burst
angrily in, saying:</p>

<p>"Nikki has just appointed that hateful money-grubber
Kokovtsov! I tried all I could to prevent it, Father.
But I have failed!"</p>

<p>Rasputin smiled at her words, and with that sinister
calmness that characterised him in moments of chagrin,
he replied:</p>

<p>"Pray do not distress thyself, O lady! Kokovtsov
will assuredly not be long in office when the hand of
Gregory is lifted against him."</p>

<p>"He must not remain long. He may get to know too
much, as others have done. In Berlin his appointment
will give the greatest offence," she said.</p>

<p>"I will ask the Almighty's intercession, for I see,
O lady, that thou art nervous and unstrung. Compose
thyself, I beg of thee. All will be well," and the "healer"
crossed himself piously.</p>

<p>Truly, the condition of our dear land was in parlous
state. A vogue for asceticism had sprung up, just as
other vogues have become popular in other European
countries.</p>

<p>As head of this circle of ascetic followers the monk
had, with the connivance of Badmayev the herbalist, invented
an expedient to deaden the flesh so as to render it
benumbed as with cocaine. Hundreds of weak-minded
women were flocking about him. Some of them were
wives and daughters of the wealthy manufacturing class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
but most were of the high aristocracy, who all regarded
my employer as the Saviour of Russia, sent by Heaven to
reform and deliver the "Holy" land from the toils of
unrest and desolation.</p>

<p>We Russians are always idealists. That is our curse.
Our religion is, unfortunately, an obsession, for any
drunken scoundrel can become a "holy man" by simply
making such declaration, and ever afterwards "sponging"
upon his neighbours. Rasputin was but an example
of this.</p>

<p>After all, it was but natural that, with the bevy of
female devotees ever at his knees, he should attract the
gossip of the scandalmongers. Much, indeed, of what
they said was true, for I happen to know that personally.</p>

<p>But on that day at Tsarskoe-Selo I noted the Empress's
agitation that Kokovtsov had been appointed,
and began to suspect that the camarilla would take drastic
action in order to defeat him. Indeed, when the Empress
had left the room, Rasputin grew thoughtful in turn, and
stroked his unkempt beard as he paced the floor, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, F&eacute;odor! We must crush this jackanapes. I
must see what we can do."</p>

<p>Weeks went by. The usual meetings of the monk's
"sister-disciples" were held at the house in the Poltavskaya,
and often in the presence of a stranger or a female
novice about to be admitted to the cult he pretended to
speak to Alexandra Feodorovna over his mock telephone.</p>

<p>Every action of the monk was that of an arrogant
and erotic swindler. His intelligence was, however, extremely
perceptive, and he was not wanting in finesse of
the mujik order, combined with a sense of foresight that
was utterly amazing. These, with his suave manner, his
affectation of deepest piety, and his wonderful fascination
over women of every age and every class, had now
brought him to the position of the power behind the
Throne.</p>

<p>He already ruled Russia. Tsar and Tsaritza were his
puppets, so cleverly did he play his cards, yet as he frequently
remarked to me in the weeks that followed:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
"Kokovtsov is against me. We are enemies. He
must go."</p>

<p>I knew that if the Premier had an enemy in Grichka,
then the statesman was doomed.</p>

<p>Now, the plot which Rasputin formed against the
new Prime Minister was an extremely clever and subtle
one.</p>

<p>While it was being carried out I often met Vladimir
Nicholaievitch, who was naturally compelled to curry
favour with the Father, and consequently sometimes
visited him even against his inclination, no doubt. He
was a long, rather narrow-faced, bearded man, with a
pair of deep-set eyes and a secretive air, subtle by temperament,
and keenly alive to his own interests as well
as those of the Empire.</p>

<p>His one sin in the eyes of Alexandra Feodorovna was
that he hated Germany.</p>

<p>"He once lost money in a German financial concern,"
Rasputin declared to me one day with a laugh. "That is
why he cannot bear the Germans."</p>

<p>The Premier, risen from the middle-class, was a dandy
who never looked one in the face, and whose eyes were
ever upon his own clothes, as though expecting to find
specks of dust upon them. He was always immaculately
dressed, and his newly-acquired manners were so perfect
that I often wondered if he carried a book of etiquette in
his pocket.</p>

<p>My own estimate of him was that he was too neat,
too well groomed, too civil, too bowing, and too anxious
not to forget what he should say at the right moment.
In a word, he was an elegant who had suddenly entered
the Court entourage, in which there was no place for him.</p>

<p>The Tsar had no affection for him, and had merely
appointed him because he believed that he might worry
him less than others whose names and abilities had been
put forward.</p>

<p>Poor Kokovtsov! He was in complete ignorance of
the clever plot which Rasputin, at the Empress's suggestion,
was engineering against his patriotic activities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
Germany intended to rule Russia in the near future, and
woe betide any statesman who would not remain
inert and be spoon-fed by Teutonic propaganda, or
place in his pocket the German marks held out so temptingly
to him. In that way lay advancement, emoluments,
decorations, and the Tsar's favour. To be Russian was,
alas! to court disaster and ignominy.</p>

<p>Monsieur Kokovtsov was typically a good Russian.
He had no fighting spirit, but was essentially a man of
peace, entertaining a horror of bloodshed or of sanguinary
deeds. His placid temper caused him to avoid all questions
in dispute. He was prepared to do all possible to
benefit our country. He had cleverly conducted the election
campaign, and had all the governors of each province
with him. The Emperor trusted him; the Empress hated
him.</p>

<p>Besides, Kokovtsov was a worker. He did not believe
in that favourite expression among Russians,
"<i>nechevo</i>," which really means "nothing," but is equivalent
to "don't bother" or "don't worry." In Russia we
unfortunately always have a "<i>zarftra</i>," or to-morrow. For
that reason he was disliked also by the people.</p>

<p>It was not many months after his appointment when
one night, at the Poltavskaya, Rasputin received a visit
from General Rogogin, the Director of the Black Cabinet,
the <i>cabinet noir</i>, the existence of which was rigorously
kept secret until the Revolution afforded the public a
glimpse of Russia behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Even from the tribune of the Duma it was declared
that the Black Cabinet was a fiction. Yet I happened
to know that it existed, for later that evening I accompanied
Rasputin and the Director to the General Post
Office, where in three rooms on the second floor of the
building the mysterious department, where correspondence
was opened and read, was situated. Here was the most
secret establishment of the Imperial Police. For over a
hundred years had this mysterious department been at
work examining the letters of all classes of people whose
thoughts or doings could be of interest to the Tsar, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
Minister of the Interior, or the Okhrana. Indeed, I
learned from the general's conversation with the monk&mdash;I
first having taken an oath never to divulge anything of
what I saw or heard&mdash;that even the correspondence of the
Tsar, his relatives, or friends was not immune from examination.</p>

<p>Then I instantly realised the reason that the Tsaritza
and Rasputin, in communicating with their friends in
Germany, sent their letters by hand.</p>

<p>On the night in question I stood watching with interest
how letters for secret examination were taken from
a lift which passed up and down from the sorting-rooms
above to the distributing room below. The basket was
taken off the lift during its slow descent, and another
basket substituted containing letters already examined,
so quickly that the man in charge of the lift below noticed
nothing.</p>

<p>We saw several processes of opening letters by steaming
them, first taking an impression in plaster of any
seal, and also by cutting off the end of the envelope by
means of a small guillotine. The letters were dexterously
opened, photographed, replaced in their respective
envelopes, refastened and new seals made, or in other
cases the ends of the cut envelopes were resealed by
means of paper pulp to match the colour of the envelope,
and placed under pressure in a hot press, thus actually
remaking the paper!</p>

<p>The watchman of this secret chamber was an illiterate,
deaf and dumb peasant.</p>

<p>"Each functionary on being first admitted here," said
Rogogin, "is compelled to take a solemn oath never to
divulge its existence to a living soul&mdash;not to his wife,
father, sister, brother, or dearest friend."</p>

<p>All was remarkable, a spying system of which I had
never dreamed.</p>

<p>When we entered the Director's well-furnished private
room and the door was closed, Rogogin took from a
locker drawer a letter which he handed to the monk,
saying:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
"Here is the letter of which I spoke; if I hold it
back it may arouse suspicion."</p>

<p>Rasputin, who could only read with difficulty, looked
at the letter, and then, handing it to me with that lofty
air he assumed in the belief that he could conceal his
ignorance, said:</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor, read it to me."</p>

<p>It was on grey paper, and was as follows:</p>




<div class="blockquot">

<p class="figright">"<span class="smcap">Imperial Russian Embassy,</span>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<br />
                   "<span class="smcap">Unter den Linden,</span> 7.<br />
                    "June 8th.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>"<i>Secret.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Your Excellency</span>,&mdash;In accordance with your instructions
I beg to report confidentially as follows: On arrival
here I presented my credentials of His Excellency our Ambassador,
and in consequence was allowed to conduct a
confidential inquiry among the staff of the Embassy, and in
other quarters, in which I have been actively assisted with
excellent results by P. Ostrovski, agent of the Okhrana in
Berlin, whom I recommend for advancement.</p>

<p>"My discoveries are several, and of an interesting nature.
First, a person named Hardt, who is often resident in Petrograd,
is the secret courier of the Empress between Potsdam
and Tsarskoe-Selo. Secondly, a sum of one hundred thousand
marks was paid by the Dresdner Bank on March 11th last
to the account of one Boris St&uuml;rmer, who has an account in
Riga at the Disconto Gesellschaft. Thirdly, the Emperor
William on April 2nd gave audience in secret at the Berlin
Schloss to M. Protopopoff, for which no reason can be
assigned. Fourthly, I have learned on the best authority
that if Herr Hardt were arrested on any of his journeys to
Sweden or Germany, some highly interesting private correspondence
would be found upon him. Fifthly, there is no
doubt whatever that the monk Rasputin is in receipt of
money from this city, as I have in my possession a receipt
given by him for two hundred thousand roubles paid him
by the Deutsche Bank, and this I am bringing with me on
my return.</p>

<p>"Further, I have documentary evidence of a widespread
German intrigue in Russia, facts which will, I feel confident,
amaze your Excellency. When I return I shall place in
your hands weapons by which the enemy may be combated.
I hesitate to send any documents through the post in case
they miscarry, and I am addressing this letter to Mademoiselle
Pauline, as your Excellency suggested.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
"I have yet some further inquiries to make on your
Excellency's behalf, but I intend to leave Berlin in any case
on the twenty-second. I have the honour to remain, your
Excellency's obedient servant,&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
<span class="smcap">Ivan Botkine."</span></p></div>

<p>The monk listened attentively, his big, strange eyes
wearing a sly, crafty expression. He fingered the jewelled
cross suspended from his neck&mdash;a habit of his.</p>

<p>"Ah! So Botkine leaves Berlin on the twenty-second.
It is well that we know this, my dear Rogogin&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed the traitorous general. "He must not
reach Russia."</p>

<p>"Of course not," agreed the monk. "We must obtain
possession of this documentary evidence that he will
carry upon him. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Botkine is a confidential agent in Kokovtsov's
employ," was the Director's reply. "He was, I find,
assistant-director of police in Nijni before the Minister
was appointed, and is now in His Excellency's private
service."</p>

<p>"Well, it is excellent that by your astuteness, my dear
General, we are forewarned. If not, there might very
easily have resulted a serious contretemps&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"And who is this Mademoiselle Pauline?" asked Rasputin,
his clever criminal brain already at work to defeat
a revelation of the truth.</p>

<p>"Pauline Lahure, the little French dancer at the Villa
Rode."</p>

<p>"Lahure!" cried Rasputin. "I know her, of course,
a music-hall artiste. She has been lately taken up by
the old Countess Bronevski. She was at my house only
a fortnight ago, and wanted to become a 'sister'!"</p>

<p>"As spy of Kokovtsov&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Without a doubt," I chimed in. "From all I hear
His Excellency is a gay dog."</p>

<p>"True, my dear F&eacute;odor," remarked the monk, fingering
the cross nervously, and then taking a cigarette which
the general offered him. "But had not our friend Rogogin
been on the alert and opened the dainty dancer's letters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
what a trap we should have fallen into&mdash;not only ourselves,
but the Empress also! Vladimir would have presented
the documents to the Emperor, and an unholy
domestic scene would have resulted. This fellow Botkine
must never reach Russia!" he added seriously.</p>

<p>"I agree," replied the general. "Let us see Gutchkoff
at once," he added. General Gutchkoff was a Jew
and the director of the dreaded political police, with whom
Rogogin, of course, worked hand-in-glove.</p>

<p>It was then nearly eleven o'clock at night, but we
all three drove to General Gutchkoff's house in the
Spaskaya. He was out, his man informed us.</p>

<p>"I must see him at once," said the monk loftily.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He went out to dinner, Holy Father, and he is
probably now at the Krestovsky or at the Bouffes."</p>

<p>"Go at once and find him," said the monk. "It is
a matter of extreme urgency, and we will await him
here."</p>

<p>Thus ordered by Gregory Rasputin&mdash;who was all-powerful
in the capital&mdash;the general's servant ushered
us into a cosy little salon, placed a box of cigarettes
and some liqueurs before us, and then himself left in a
droshky to find his master, who was so well known in
Petrograd as a <i>bon viveur</i>.</p>

<p>For half an hour Rasputin, much worried by the secret
inquiries of the Premier into the doings of the pro-German
camarilla, chatted with the general, more than
once expressing fear regarding the perilous situation.</p>

<p>"Revelations seem imminent," he exclaimed anxiously.
"The man Botkine must never arrive in Russia&mdash;you
understand that, Rogogin!"</p>

<p>"I quite agree," said the Director of the Black
Cabinet. "But Gutchkoff must see to it. I have done
my part in the affair."</p>

<p>"You have done excellently, my dear friend&mdash;most
excellently," declared the monk. "Nothing could have
been better. I will mention your great services to the
Empress. Yes, we must rely upon Gutchkoff."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
In half an hour the servant returned with his master,
the head of the political police, a short, fat man in
general's uniform, with decorations, who, when he
entered the room, betrayed unmistakable signs of having
dined well. Indeed, he had been unearthed from a midnight
carouse at a questionable restaurant.</p>

<p>At sight of Rasputin, a power to be reckoned with
and a person of whom even the greatest in the land
craved favours, he pulled himself together and cast himself
into a chair to listen.</p>

<p>The monk was clever enough not to enlighten the
Police Director regarding the plot to upset Kokovtsov's
undue inquisitiveness. He merely told him that a certain
secret agent named Botkine was leaving Berlin for
Petrograd on the twenty-second.</p>

<p>"The man is dangerous," he added, "extremely
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Gutchkoff, somewhat surprised at our
midnight visit.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, because I happen to know that he
is in possession of certain facts concerning very high
personages. He is a blackmailer, and has been to Berlin
to endeavour to sell some documents to Maximilian
Harden&mdash;documents which, if published, would place a
certain member of our Imperial family in a very unsatisfactory
light," Rasputin said. "My friend Rogogin
here will bear me out."</p>

<p>The Police Director, after a few minutes' silence,
asked:</p>

<p>"Has he sold the documents in question?"</p>

<p>"I think not," was Rasputin's reply. "If he has not,
he will have them in his possession on his return. We
must secure them at all costs."</p>

<p>"You wish to close his mouth&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He must be suppressed at all hazards," declared
the monk. "It is the wish of the Emperor," he
added, a glib lie always ready upon his tongue. "Further,
I need not add that if this affair be conducted in secrecy
and scandal in the Imperial House avoided, His Majesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
will certainly see that you are adequately rewarded. I
can promise you that."</p>

<p>General Gutchkoff was again silent. He well knew
that if the Tsar had ordered the man Botkine to be
silenced there must be some very unsavoury affair to be
hushed up.</p>

<p>"There is an agent of yours in Berlin named
Ostrovski, is there not?" the monk asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then he must also be removed at once to another
post. Transfer him to Constantinople, or, better still, to
Yokohama. He must not remain in Berlin another
twenty-four hours, and he must, not, at any cost,
be allowed to return to Russia," Rasputin said
decisively.</p>

<p>"I scarcely follow you, Holy Father," was the amazed
general's reply. "Ostrovski is very reliable, and has been
entrusted with the most delicate affairs. He has always
given me the greatest satisfaction."</p>

<p>"I regret if he is under your protection, but that
does not alter matters. He and Botkine have been
acting in unison, and hence Ostrovski knows more of
this scandal concerning a certain member of the Imperial
family than is good for him to know. Promote him with
increased salary to Yokohama, and send him there by
way of Marseilles upon some confidential mission. But
on no account must he return to Russia before going to
Japan&mdash;you understand? He will no doubt wish to travel
by way of Siberia, but this must be forbidden. If you
will write out his appointment, I will obtain the Emperor's
signature to it to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"You wish me to write out the order now&mdash;eh?"
asked Gutchkoff, still much puzzled, but eager to get scent
of the particular scandal known to Botkine.</p>

<p>"Yes, now," replied the monk, pointing to the writing-table,
whereupon the Police Director sat down and wrote
out the order transferring the agent Ostrovski to Japan,
an order which Rasputin, after pretending to read it,
handed to me to place in my pocket.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
"And now, what about this person Botkine?" asked
Gutchkoff. "How do you wish me to act towards
him?"</p>

<p>"In the way that I will direct to-morrow," replied
the monk. "I must have time to devise some plan&mdash;a plan
which will be secret and arouse no suspicion," he added
grimly, with a sinister smile.</p>

<p>Early next morning I accompanied him to Peterhof,
where the Imperial Court happened to be. Anna Vyrubova
was away in Moscow, but without delay he sought
the Empress and remained in her boudoir for a full hour,
no doubt explaining the discovery of Kokovtsov's inquiries
in Berlin.</p>

<p>I met the Prime Minister himself in the long corridor
guarded by "Araby" servants which led to the Emperor's
private cabinet, and with him was General Gutchkoff,
who had evidently also been summoned to audience regarding
some matters concerning the police administration.
Kokovtsov had no suspicion of what Rasputin had
learned, or that Gutchkoff had promised to act as he
directed against his trusted agent Ivan Botkine.</p>

<p>The pair strolled along the softly carpeted corridor,
chatting affably, for they were apparently going to consult
His Majesty together. Truly, the Court world is a
strange life of constant intrigue and double-dealing, of
lack of morals and of honesty of purpose and of
patriotism. In our Holy Russia many good men and
women have, because of their love for their own land,
been sent to drag out their lives in the dreariness of the
Siberian prison camps.</p>

<p>When the monk returned to me he asked for Ostrovski's
appointment, written on the previous night, which
I carried in my pocket. This he took at once to
the Tsar. His Majesty was at that moment closeted
with the Prime Minister, Gutchkoff having already seen
the Emperor and, transacting his business, been dismissed.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Rasputin returned with the Emperor's
scribbled signature still wet, and in my presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
handed it to the Director of Political Police. Ostrovski
had been transferred to Japan, where he would be harmless,
even though he might have learned facts from Botkine.
But what had Rasputin decided should be the
fate of the latter? For the sake of Alexandra Feodorovna
and the whole camarilla Botkine's lips must, I knew, be
closed. That had been decided. I longed to learn what
the Empress had said when the monk had revealed the
truth to her and pointed out her peril.</p>

<p>No doubt Her Majesty would see to it that the affair
was hushed up. I knew full well that she understood
that once Kokovtsov obtained evidence too many people
would be implicated, and perhaps a public trial might
result. Both she and Rasputin, no doubt, realised that
it would be unwise to allow a member of the Okhrana&mdash;as
Botkine had been&mdash;to be arrested, for fear of the
scandal public revelations would cause. The capital
teemed with Germans like St&uuml;rmer and Fredericks,
traitors like Protopopoff and Soukhomlinoff, men like
Azeff, Guerassimoff and Kurtz&mdash;one day the bosom
friend of Ministers and powerful noblemen, and the next
cast into the fortress of Peter and Paul&mdash;Rogogin, the
sycophant Raeff&mdash;whom Rasputin had made Procurator
of the Holy Synod&mdash;and the drunken "saint" Mitia the
Blessed&mdash;at last dismissed&mdash;spiritualists, charlatans, and
cranks. Upon such fine society was the Throne of the
Romanoffs based! Was it any wonder that it was
already tottering preparatory to its fall?</p>

<p>I left Peterhof with Rasputin at about three o'clock
that afternoon, and on our return to the Poltavskaya I
spoke over the telephone, at the monk's orders, to
Doctor Badmayev, the expert herbalist who prepared
those secret drugs with which Madame Vyrubova
regularly doped the little Tsarevitch, keeping him in a
constant state of ill-health and in such a condition that
he puzzled the most noted physicians in Europe.</p>

<p>Badmayev, a small, ferret-eyed man, his features of
Tartar cast, came and dined with us, after which Rasputin
signed a cheque for twenty-eight thousand roubles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
a sum to which "the doctor" was entitled under an
agreement. Well did I know that the sum in question
was payment for his active assistance in supplying certain
drugs of which the monk in turn declared that he
himself held the formula. The drugs&mdash;which he pretended
to be the secret of the priests of Tibet&mdash;were those which
he doled out in small quantities to his sister-disciples,
and which produced insensibility to physical pain, drugs
which were so baneful and pernicious that the monk
always warned me against them, and never took any
himself.</p>

<p>After dinner, at which they both drank deeply of
champagne, the monk and his friend went out to spend
the evening at a low-class variety theatre, while I was
left alone until midnight.</p>

<p>In consequence I visited some friends in the Ivanovskaya,
and returned to Rasputin's at about a quarter-past
twelve. Twenty minutes later he returned in a hopeless
state of intoxication; therefore I did not speak to
him till next morning.</p>

<p>Such was the fellow's vitality that he was up before
six o'clock. At seven he went out, and returned about
nine, when he called me to his den.</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor," he said, "I wish you to leave to-day for
Vilna, and go to the Palace Hotel there. Remain until
a friend of ours named Heckel calls upon you."</p>

<p>"Who is Heckel?" I asked, surprised at being sent
upon such a long journey in that sudden manner.</p>

<p>"A friend of Hardt and myself. Do not be inquisitive&mdash;only
obey. When Heckel calls please give him
this letter," and he handed me a rather thick letter in an
official cartridge envelope of the Imperial Ministry of
Foreign Affairs. "Heckel will tell you that he is from
'Father Gregory.' He is tall, fair, and rather slim&mdash;a
German, as you may guess from his name. Your train
leaves at two-forty this afternoon. Be careful of that
letter and to whom you deliver it in secret. Heckel,
after finding you at the hotel, will produce an English
five-pound note and show it to you. That will be his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
passport. If he does not do so, then do not give him the
letter."</p>

<p>That afternoon I left for Vilna by the Warsaw express,
and after a long journey through the endless
pines and silver birches duly arrived at the hotel indicated,
and there awaited my visitor. He arrived next
day, a fair-haired, slim man, just as Rasputin had described
him, evidently an <i>agent-provocateur</i> from Berlin.
After he had been ushered into my bedroom by a
waiter, he greeted me warmly, and inquired if I had anything
to hand him.</p>

<p>To this I made an evasive reply, in pretence of being
in ignorance of his meaning, whereupon he said in
German:</p>

<p>"Ah! I forgot. You wish first to establish my
identity," and laughingly he produced from his wallet an
English five-pound note, which he showed to me.</p>

<p>In consequence I handed him the letter from the
Ministry, which he placed unopened in his pocket and
then left, while that same night I returned to Petrograd.</p>

<p>Three days later I learned the truth.</p>

<p>Ivan Botkine, the trusted secret agent of the Prime
Minister Kokovtsov, who had left Berlin on the twenty-second
for Petrograd, had been found dead in one of the
sleeping compartments on the arrival of the train at the
frontier station of Wirballen. His pockets and valise
had been rifled, and an inquiry had been opened. Though
the doctors disagreed as to the exact cause of death, it
was apparent that one of the dishes he had eaten in the
restaurant car an hour before had been poisoned.</p>

<p>Further, I have since established the horrifying fact
that the mysterious letter from the Ministry which I
handed to Heckel in Vilna contained a secret poison!
That it was used to remove poor Botkine, Rasputin afterwards
admitted to me. Such were the methods of the
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'camerilla'">camarilla</ins> who were ruling Russia!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">rasputin in berlin</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Truly</span>, our Russia was a country of blood and tears under
the last of the Romanoffs. Its creed and its motto was
"Gallows and Siberia!"</p>

<p>No man's life was safe under a r&eacute;gime run by
scoundrels, of whom "Grichka," my chief, was the worst.</p>

<p>An unlimited secret fund was placed at the disposal
of the Ministry of the Interior for purposes of the Secret
Police, and when I say that Rasputin controlled that
Ministry as well as the Emperor himself, it can easily be
understood that all who were loyal Russians were "suspect,"
and denunciation throve on all sides. The
Okhrana recruited its agents from all quarters. That is
why one was never sure that the stranger who denounced
Rasputin and his friends was not an <i>agent-provocateur</i>.</p>

<p>Every Russian subject of any note, and every foreign
traveller, was watched, not because of his disloyalty, but
because Rasputin and his camarilla, including the Empress,
feared lest he should discover how they were
daily betraying Russia and its Tsar.</p>

<p>I have been, at Rasputin's orders, many times in the
central bureau of the Secret Police in search of the
index-card of some person who had fallen beneath the
monk's displeasure. In these indices and in the corresponding
files the persons concerned were, I found, never
designated by their own names, but by code-names that
could be telegraphed if necessary from city to city.
Thus the Deputy Cheidze (since become famous) was
registered under the name of "drawing-room" (gostini),
Lenin (also since famous) as "symbol," <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Miliukof'">Miliukoff</ins> as
"grass," and the traitor Soukhomlinoff as "glycerine."</p>

<p>Those were indeed terrible days in Holy Russia&mdash;days
when the innocent were sent to their death, while Rasputin,
the religious fraud, laughed and drank champagne
with his high-born devotees, who believed him, even in
this twentieth century, to be divine!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
I remember that on May 16th, 1914, when the political
horizon was cloudless and no one dreamed of war, I sat
in the visitors' gallery of the Duma, having been sent
there by Rasputin to listen to the debate and report to
him.</p>

<p>The labour leader Kerensky, who afterwards became
Minister of Justice in the Provisional Government, rose
and from the tribune proclaimed the infamy of the police.
He did not mince matters. He said:</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins>The most notorious jailers of the period of Alexander
III. knew how to respect in their political enemies
the man who thought differently, and when they shut him
up in the fortress of Schl&uuml;sselburg they would sometimes
come to chat with him. And some of those martyrs,
those men struggling for liberty, have been able to return
to us with the glamour about them of twenty years' hard
labour. But now, the sons of those famous jailers do
not hesitate to seize young men of seventeen or eighteen
and make them die slowly, but surely, under the blows of
the knout, under the strokes of the rod, or by the burns
of a red-hot iron. Are we not returning to the days when
political prisoners were walled up alive? And you
imagine, gentlemen, that you can claim for this country
the civilising mission of a European nation!"</p>

<p>He spoke of a man whom I knew well, one of the most
sinister persons in all Russia, a man who, like Rasputin
and St&uuml;rmer, accepted German gold. The man's name
was Evno Azef, upon whom unfortunately the French
Government bestowed the Legion of Honour.</p>

<p>Before he went to Paris, Azef was a close friend of
Rasputin and of St&uuml;rmer. He was a criminal of the
worst type, an expert in crime, though he was a recognised
agent of the Russian Political Police. And yet so
clever was he as an <i>agent-provocateur</i> that he actually
managed to get himself elected as director of the Terrorist
organisation of Petrograd, and as a member of the
Central Committee of the Socialist Party!</p>

<p>In my presence he one night, when in his cups, boasted
to the merry monk what he had to his credit as a revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>tionary.
He organised the murders of the Minister of
the Interior, Plehve, and of the Grand Duke Sergius. It
was he who prepared the attempted murders of Admiral
Dubassof, the Governor-General Guerchelman, and the
attempt on Nicholas II. The latter was with Rasputin's
knowledge and consent! Perhaps Alexandra Feodorovna
knew of it. Who knows? That she was not so devoted
to "Nikki" as she pretended is well known to everyone
who was at the Imperial Court at the time. Happily,
however, the plot failed because of circumstances which
Azef could not control.</p>

<p>The scoundrel also assisted in the drawing up of the
plans for the military mutinies at Moscow, Viborg, and
Kronstadt, while he knew beforehand of the preparations
for the assassination of General Sakarof, and of Governor
Bogdanovitch at Ufa, as well as a number of Terrorist
crimes which succeeded.</p>

<p>One of his crimes in conspiracy with Rasputin I will
here relate, because it is a mystery which has long puzzled
the London police.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 11th, 1909, the London
newspapers contained a report of a strange discovery.
Four days before there had arrived at Victoria Station a
young French lady, dark-haired and extremely good-looking,
who took a cab to a small but highly respectable
private hotel in the vicinity. There she gave the name
of Mademoiselle Thomas, and her profession as governess.
Next morning a tall, thin young foreigner called for her,
and they went out together, she returning very late that
night apparently exhausted after a long motor journey.
Next day she remained in her room all day. On the
third day an elderly man called, and she went out with
him, being absent about a couple of hours. On her
return she went straight to her room and nothing was
seen of her further until the next day at noon the chambermaid
failed to arouse her by knocking. The police
were informed, the door was forced, and Mademoiselle
Thomas was found dead. She was lying upon the floor
fully dressed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
The medical evidence at the inquest was that the
pretty French governess had been dead fully eighteen
hours. Upon her or in her small hand-luggage there
was nothing to establish her identity. That she had
taken poison was the opinion of the expert medical witness.
Yet the poison could not be established. Apparently
it was a case of suicide, for the laundry marks
and names of the makers of her clothing had been
deliberately removed.</p>

<p>One thing, however, was extremely mysterious.
Upon the marble top of the washhand-stand in the bedroom
the police found some scrawled words in a character
they could not decipher. Experts were brought in, when
it was found that the writing was in Russian character,
and the words were: "The holy Starets is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This conveyed nothing to the London police, who, of
course, knew nothing save that a "Starets" in Russia
is a "saint."</p>

<p>Therefore the experts at Scotland Yard were, after
much patient investigation, compelled to dismiss it as
one of London's unsolved mysteries.</p>

<p>Now for the truth.</p>

<p>One night, a year before, when I had returned with
Rasputin from Tsarskoe-Selo, we found awaiting us the
somewhat dandified man of a hundred aliases and as many
disguises, the notorious Azef. He greeted us both
warmly, and being a close friend of Rasputin, the monk
took him into his cosy little den, where for over an hour
they remained closeted together.</p>

<p>I was one of the few who knew the secret of Azef's
crimes. Indeed, when I entered the room while the pair
were talking I heard him ask with a laugh:</p>

<p>"What if we give him a taste of the necktie of Stolypin&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"It certainly would be best, my dear Evno," the monk
agreed. "That is if you think the accusation can be well
made."</p>

<p>"Trust me," laughed the great <i>agent-provocateur</i>.
"A denunciation, the discovery of papers&mdash;you have those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
of Buchman in your safe, by the way, and they could be
used&mdash;arrest, trial, and the necktie! It would be quite
easy, and his mouth would be closed."</p>

<p>"He is growing dangerous," growled Rasputin.
"What you say is perfectly true."</p>

<p>Then turning to me, he said:</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor, bring those papers which Manuiloff brought
me a week ago&mdash;the papers used for the arrest of Professor
Buchman in Warsaw."</p>

<p>I obeyed, well knowing how that file of incriminating
correspondence with an Anarchist group in Zurich had
been forged by St&uuml;rmer's secretary Manuiloff, and how it
had been found among the professor's effects.</p>

<p>"The necktie of Stolypin," was Azef's playful allusion
to the ever-ready gallows to which he, plotting with Rasputin,
Manuiloff, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Geurassimof'">Guerassimof</ins>, and others, was so constantly
sending innocent persons. Truly, Russia was a
strange country even before the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>The immediate object of Azef's activities, combined
with Rasputin's, was at Germany's direction to extend
the Terrorist action and thus cause trouble and unrest in
the Empire. By every fresh success he obtained more
money from Berlin, and at the same time strengthened
his privileged position in the ranks of the Terrorists, while
his worth was increased in the eyes of both the Minister
of the Interior and of the Emperor. The scoundrel's revolutionary
career and his police career were inseparable.
He was a Terrorist to-day, a police official to-morrow, but,
like Rasputin, a secret agent of Germany always!</p>

<p>Terrible as it may seem, the Okhrana, with the connivance
of the Wilhelmstrasse, and with the Empress's
full knowledge&mdash;of this there is no doubt, because documentary
evidence exists which proves it&mdash;caused the
highest personages in Russia to be murdered or hanged
in order to prove to those lucky ones who survived how
necessary was the organisation for their own existence!</p>

<p>A hundred dramas could be written upon the intrigues
of Grichka and Azef. Some of them were
amazing; all were disgraceful. The life of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
upright and honest man or woman was not safe if marked
down by the pair of scoundrels. The attempt upon
Admiral Dubassof, in which Count Konovnicin met his
death; the attempt upon General Guerchelman, Governor-General
of Moscow; the assassination of General Slepzof
at Tver, with half a dozen other murders of the same
kind, were all the work of Azef. Why? Because both
Azef and General Guerassimof, chief of the Secret Police,
were in the toils of Germany. The Wilhelmstrasse paid
well, but threatened exposures if this or that person were
not removed. Hence Azef, as one of the heads of the
Terrorists, received his orders through Rasputin, and,
obeying, was paid his blood-money.</p>

<p>Many of the dastardly crimes which Azef, aided by
the monk, committed at Germany's orders will never be
known. Hundreds of innocent persons were arrested,
and when the police searched their homes the most incriminating
documents were found concealed&mdash;documents
which when produced they had never before seen. Hundreds
of men and women were hurried to Siberia, and
hundreds of others were sent to rot in jails and fortresses,
while upon dozens there was placed "the necktie of
Stolypin."</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear Gregory," Azef said, after he had lit a
fresh cigarette, "there will be no security until that man's
mouth is closed. I see that you agree with me."</p>

<p>"Quite," replied the monk, who, I saw, was rather
agitated because of something which the police spy had
told him.</p>

<p>"Good! Then I will go further. To-day I have proposed
to the Council of Workmen's Delegates that we
should blow up the Central Bureau of the Okhrana, with
Guerassimof in the centre of it. The killing of Guerassimof
appealed to them. They hate him&mdash;as you know.
Really, those people are humorous. They think I am
their friend, and yet each day the police arrest one or
two members regularly but quietly, and they disappear
no one knows whither. I have suspicions of Menchikof,
of the Okhrana at Moscow. The other day I met him at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
Princess Kamenskoi's, and what he told me set me
wondering. He poses as your friend, but I feel convinced
he is your enemy."</p>

<p>Rasputin's bearded face relaxed into that strange,
sardonic grin of his as he replied:</p>

<p>"I know Menchikof. He is harmless. The only man
we may fear is Burtsef. He knows far too much of the
police organisation and the deeds of our provocating
agents."</p>

<p>"I agree. But he lives in Paris, and hence the
Okhrana cannot lay hands upon him. If only he would
return to Russia, then he would not be long at liberty.
That I assure you."</p>

<p>"He is in Paris. Could we not send him a message
that his daughter Vera&mdash;who married young Tchernof
last year&mdash;has been taken suddenly ill, and thus summon
him at once to Vilna? Once on Russian soil he could
be arrested."</p>

<p>Azef smiled. "Our friend Burtsef knows a little too
much of our methods to fall into such a trap. He would
recognise my hand in it in an instant. No, some other
means must be found. Meanwhile we must deal with
the person under discussion. We were agreed that he
must be suppressed at all hazards, eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And we must suppress Burtsef afterwards."</p>

<p>Paris, Lausanne, Geneva, Zurich and Nice swarmed
with Russian secret agents, who, at orders from Azef
and Rasputin, kept constant vigil upon the doings
of everyone. The directors of the foreign service of our
political police were Ratchkovsky in Paris, and Rataef in
London. The latter posed as a Russian journalist, and
usually spent his afternoons over cups of coffee in the
cosmopolitan Caf&eacute; Royal in Regent Street.</p>

<p>All this I knew, and much more. I knew that Ivan
Manuiloff, who was now secretary to St&uuml;rmer, had begun
his lucrative career as the agent and catspaw of Ratchkovsky
in Paris. But he intrigued against his chief,
and was then transferred to Rome. Of that man and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
dastardly doings I will tell more later. Suffice it
to say that the Emperor so deeply believed in him that
one day he gave him a gold cigarette-case with his initials
in diamonds "as a mark of his esteem"!</p>

<p>Having listened attentively to the conversation between
the two scoundrels, I at last came to the conclusion
that they were conspiring against some mysterious person
named Krivochein.</p>

<p>After the pair had consumed a bottle of champagne,
Azef rose and, shaking his friend's dirty paw, said:</p>

<p>"I hope to have everything arranged when we meet.
I would not yet mention the matter to the Empress."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall not," remarked Rasputin, with
that crafty grin of his. "She would only worry over it&mdash;and
just now she is greatly troubled over the Tsarevitch.
He has had another attack."</p>

<p>The monk did not mention the fact that the cause of
the attack was one of Badmayev's secret drugs which
Anna Vyrubova had dissolved in his milk!</p>

<p>After Azef had left, Rasputin flung himself into his
easy chair, and as he lit a cigarette remarked to me:</p>

<p>"Ah, F&eacute;odor! What a man! There is nothing he is
unable to accomplish."</p>

<p>"He is very daring," I remarked.</p>

<p>"No, it is not daring&mdash;it is deep cunning. He has
the police at his back; I have Alexandra Feodorovna&mdash;so
we win always. But," he added, with a snarl, "we
have enemies, and those must be dealt with&mdash;dealt with
drastically. I hear they are setting about more scandals
in Petrograd concerning me. Have you heard them?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Gossip is rife on every hand, and all sorts of wild
stories are being circulated," I said.</p>

<p>"Bah! Let the fools say what they will of Gregory
Rasputin," he laughed. "It only makes him the more
popular. It is time, however, that I performed some
more miracles among the poor," he added reflectively.
"Let us arrange some, F&eacute;odor. Do not forget it."</p>

<p>The miracles were arranged a fortnight later. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
the assistance of a clever German conjurer named Brockhaus,
from Riga, who with others helped the mock saint
on the occasions when he imposed upon the credulity of
the mujiks, he pretended to "heal" a child of lameness,
while a female assistant of Brockhaus, having posed as a
blind peasant, was restored to sight.</p>

<p>The miracles took place out at Ligovo, a village outside
Petrograd, and like wildfire the news was spread
that the Holy Father had again taken compassion upon
the people. Hundreds of men and women now flocked
round him to kiss the edge of his ragged robe, and as he
passed in the streets everyone crossed themselves. By
such means did Rasputin retain the favour of the people
and of the Empress herself.</p>

<p>One night he received a telegram in cipher, which he
gave me to decode. It had been despatched from Paris
and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The appointment is at Savignyplatz, 17, Charlottenburg.
Do not fail. Please inform A. [Alexandra Feodorovna]
and obtain instructions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Evno.</span>"</p></div>

<p>At once Rasputin became active. He went to Peterhof,
where the Court was at that moment, and carried out
Azef's desire. He was with the Empress and Madame
Vyrubova for a couple of hours ere he rejoined me, and
we took the evening train back to the capital.</p>

<p>That night he called upon St&uuml;rmer, who had with
him his sycophant and ex-policeman Manuiloff, and they
held counsel together. Then, next afternoon, we both
left Petrograd for Berlin.</p>

<p>We had no difficulty in discovering the house in the
Savignyplatz. It was a good-sized one on the corner of
the Kantstrasse, and the old woman who opened the
door at once ushered us into a pretty drawing-room,
where we were greeted by a rather tall, dark-haired and
refined young lady, who welcomed us in Russian, and
whose name Rasputin had told me was Mademoiselle
Paula Kereicha.</p>

<p>"You must be very tired after your long journey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
Father," she said, bowing her head and crossing herself
as the monk mumbled a blessing upon her.</p>

<p>"No; travelling is very easy between Petrograd and
Berlin," he replied affably; and then he introduced me.</p>

<p>I could see that somehow she resented my intrusion
there. She glanced at Rasputin inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," laughed the monk. "I quite understand,
mademoiselle; you need have no fear." Then lowering
his voice to a whisper, he said: "I know full well that
living here as secret agent of the Okhrana you have to
exercise every caution."</p>

<p>Paula Kereicha&mdash;who I afterwards found was a
second-rate variety actress who sometimes took engagements
in order to blind people to her own calling, that
of police-spy&mdash;smiled and admitted that she had to be very
careful.</p>

<p>"It is not the Germans that I fear," she said. "They
know me well at the Wilhelmstrasse, and I am never interfered
with. Indeed, they assist me when necessary.
No. It is the Terrorists who would do me harm if they
could. There is a dangerous group here&mdash;as you know."</p>

<p>"I know well," said the monk; "only last week
Tchapline and Vilieff were given Stolypin's necktie owing
to your denunciations. They came to Russia from Berlin,
and were arrested immediately they set foot across the
frontier."</p>

<p>"No," she protested. "Azef was here. It was he
who put papers into their baggage, and then telegraphed
to the police at Wirballen. Neither of the men was
dangerous as far as I could see, but our friend Evno
believed them to be; hence he deemed them better out
of the way."</p>

<p>I could see that the young woman had some scruples
regarding the dirty work for which she received money
from the Ministry of the Interior in Petrograd. And
surely hers was a highly dangerous profession.</p>

<p>Apparently it was not desired that Rasputin's arrival
in Berlin should be known, for we were shown to our
rooms by the stout old Russian woman, and I heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
the handsome Paula speaking on the telephone in a
guarded manner.</p>

<p>"And you will call at half-past nine to-night, eh?" I
heard her ask, and presently she rang off.</p>

<p>We ate our dinner together, the monk being very
gracious towards his mysterious hostess; and almost
punctually at half-past nine the door of the drawing-room
opened, and there entered a rather shabbily dressed man,
whom I at once recognised as Count von Wedel, the inseparable
companion of the Kaiser, and titular head of
the German Secret Service. With him was no less a
person than the German Foreign Minister, Kiderlen-Waechter.
Our visitors were the two Men Behind the
Throne of Imperial Germany. Standing with them was
that man of kaleidoscopic make-up, the great Azef
himself.</p>

<p>That meeting was indeed a dramatic one. Rasputin,
taking bribes on every side from officials in Russia who
desired advancement, and from the Germans to betray
Russia into the hands of the Wilhelmstrasse, sat that
evening in the elegant little room listening to the conversation,
with all the craft and cunning of the Russian
mujik. He made but few remarks, but sat with his
hands upon his knees, his deep-set, fiery eyes glancing
everywhere about him, his big bejewelled cross scintillating
beneath the electric light of the pretty Paula's
elegant, tastily furnished little room.</p>

<p>Von Wedel, though dressed so shabbily, was the chief
spokesman. Kiderlen-Waechter, who had so cleverly
pulled the strings of Germany's diplomacy in the Near
East, and had now been recalled to Berlin and placed
at the helm of the Fatherland's double-dealing with the
Powers, spoke little. He seemed to be learning much
of the Kaiser's duplicity.</p>

<p>"The Emperor William, I can tell you frankly,
Father, is displeased," von Wedel said to Rasputin
reprovingly. "Only by an ace has the whole of our
arrangements with your Empress, and with yourself as
our agent, been suppressed from Downing Street. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
that by steps taken by our friend here, Monsieur Azef.
But we are not yet safe. I tell you quite frankly that
though you are a good servant of ours, yet your habit
of taking intoxicants is dangerous. You boast too much!
If you are to succeed you must assume an attitude of
extreme humility combined with poverty. Be a second
St. Francis of Assisi," added the Count, with humour.
"You can act any part. Imitate a real saint."</p>

<p>"It surely is not through a fault of mine that any
secret has leaked out," the monk protested.</p>

<p>"But it is," the Count declared severely. "I am
here to-night at the Emperor's orders to tell you from
him that, though he appreciates all your efforts on his
behalf, he disapproves of your drunkenness and your
boastful tongue."</p>

<p>"I am not boastful!" the monk declared. "Have
you brought me here to Berlin to reprimand me? If so,
I will return at once."</p>

<p>And he rose arrogantly from his chair, and crossed
his hands over his breast piously in that attitude he
assumed when unusually angry.</p>

<p>Von Wedel saw that he was going too far.</p>

<p>"It is not a matter of reproof, but of precaution,"
he said quickly. "Happily the truth has been suppressed,
though a certain agent of Downing Street&mdash;a
man known by the nickname of 'Mac'&mdash;very nearly
ascertained the whole facts. Fortunately for us all he
did not. But his suspicions are aroused, together with
those of Krivochein."</p>

<p>"Cannot this man Mac&mdash;an Englishman, I suppose&mdash;be
suppressed?" asked Rasputin. "If he is in Russia
I can crush him as a fly upon the window-pane."</p>

<p>"Ah! but he is not in Russia," replied the Count.
"He is a very elusive person, and one who tricks us
every time. 'Mac the Spy,' as they call him at Whitehall,
is the first secret agent in Europe&mdash;next, of course,
to our dear Steinhauer."</p>

<p>"I disagree," interrupted the Foreign Secretary.
"The man Mac is marvellous. He was in Constantinople<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
and in Bucharest recently, and he learned secrets of
our Embassy and Legation which I believed to be sacred.
He even got hold of our diplomatic telegraph code
a week after it had been changed. No, the English
Mac is the most astute secret agent in Europe, depend
upon it!"</p>

<p>Paula Kereicha sat listening to the conversation, but
without making any remark. I noticed that Azef seemed
very uneasy at her presence, and presently sent her
from the room to ask for a telephone call. The instant
she had gone he exclaimed in a low voice:</p>

<p>"It is a pity to have spoken before Paula! She
knows too much. One day, when it suits her, she may
reveal something unpleasant concerning us."</p>

<p>"But you made the appointment here, at her house!"
Kiderlen-Waechter protested.</p>

<p>"Of course, because it is the safest meeting-place,
but I did not know that matters were to be freely
discussed before her."</p>

<p>"Then you do not trust the woman?" remarked
Rasputin. "You are like myself, I never trust women,"
and he grinned. "Shall we drop our conversation when
she returns?"</p>

<p>Azef reflected for a few moments.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "She knows most of the details of
the affair. There is no reason why she should not know
the rest. Besides, I may require her to assist me."</p>

<p>In the discussion which ensued I gathered that Rasputin
and Azef had resolved, with the connivance and
at the instigation of the German Foreign Office, to
assassinate a certain well-known British member of
Parliament who had been in Russia and had learned,
through the British secret agent Mac, the betrayal of
Russia into the hands of the Wilhelmstrasse. It was
believed that this Englishman&mdash;whom Rasputin had nicknamed
"Krivochein," so that in correspondence his
identity should not be revealed&mdash;would place certain facts
before the British Government to the detriment of the
plans of the pro-German party in Russia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
Of the actual identity of the unfortunate member of
Parliament whom Azef and Rasputin had marked down
as their victim I could not learn. No doubt Paula knew
who "Krivochein" was. And it was certain also that
both von Wedel and the German Foreign Secretary were
privy to the plot.</p>

<p>Apparently the Empress had been informed of the
danger, and knew of the steps the conspirators were
taking. Indeed, Rasputin declared:</p>

<p>"Alexandra Feodorovna is very anxious as to the
future. She has had a violent quarrel with Nicholas
regarding his refusal to dismiss Sheglovitof."</p>

<p>"He must be dismissed," declared von Wedel. "The
Emperor William insists upon it. Each hour he remains
in office he becomes more dangerous."</p>

<p>"I am already engineering disagreements in the
Duma," the monk replied. "If he does not fall by
them, then he will go naturally, for he is not a puppet
hypnotised by the wishes of Tsarskoe-Selo, as are so
many of our Ministers. The Tsar, who so quickly takes
offence nowadays, prefers flunkeys to Ministers whose
personality is too marked. Besides, we have the Woman
[the Empress] ever on our side. No, Sheglovitof's hour
has come."</p>

<p>The meeting lasted nearly three hours, until at last
Azef and the two German officials left, and Rasputin
went to his room, where he consumed half a bottle of
brandy. Meanwhile I sat chatting with Mademoiselle
Paula until it was time to retire.</p>

<p>Next day, in consequence of a telephone message, I
left with Rasputin for Paris, where we put up at the
Grand Hotel, being visited on the day following our
arrival by Azef, who, dressed differently, I would certainly
have passed in the street unrecognised. The two
scoundrels retired to Rasputin's room, where they remained
for half an hour, and then we all three went
forth into the sunshine of the boulevard.</p>

<p>"It is about his time to pass," the notorious spy
remarked to the monk, who, by the way, wore an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
ordinary suit of tweeds and a soft felt hat. "Let us
sit here&mdash;at the Grand Caf&eacute;."</p>

<p>In consequence we took seats at one of the little tables
on the <i>terrasse</i> and ordered "bocks."</p>

<p>Presently, as we watched the stream of passers-by,
Azef raised the newspaper he had been pretending to
read, so concealing his face, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Here he is! That is our friend Krivochein!"</p>

<p>I looked and saw a well-dressed, quiet-looking English
gentleman passing along with his wife, who had apparently
been shopping. Little did he dream that the
eyes of the two most evil men in Europe were upon
him.</p>

<p>"He leaves to-night on his return to London," remarked
Azef, when five minutes later we rose and returned
to the hotel.</p>

<p>That same afternoon Rasputin, who declared that he
had a bad headache, sent me to an English chemist's in
the Avenue de l'Op&eacute;ra for a bottle of tabloids of aspirin.
I was rather surprised, for he never took drugs. When
I gave him the little bottle he drew out the plug of
cotton-wool and extracted a tabloid, which he put upon
his dressing-table, afterwards replacing the wool.</p>

<p>About six o'clock a lady was announced, and when
she was shown up to our sitting-room I found to my
surprise that it was Paula Kereicha.</p>

<p>Rasputin was out with Azef, so Paula declared that
she would wait till their return.</p>

<p>"I am staying at the H&ocirc;tel Chatham, and have to
go to London to-morrow," she told me. "Krivochein
has left the Chatham with his wife, and I am to follow."</p>

<p>"The Father and Azef have gone round to the
Chatham," I said. "They are evidently hoping to find
you there."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then I will return and see if they are there,"
she said, and, rising, she left.</p>

<p>I did not see her again. She went to London next
day, according to Azef's instructions, and as a French
governess took a room in that quiet hotel near Victoria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
Station&mdash;the room wherein she was afterwards found
dead.</p>

<p>At the time I had no knowledge of the tragedy, but
later on I learned from Rasputin's own lips, while in one of
his drunken, boastful moods, how he had introduced into
the bottle of aspirin a single tabloid of one of Badmayev's
secret poisons, made up to resemble exactly the other
tabloids. With Azef he had gone to the H&ocirc;tel Chatham
on purpose to extract from her dressing-case her own
bottle of aspirin&mdash;which she had purchased on the previous
day from the same chemist in the Avenue de l'Op&eacute;ra&mdash;and
replace it by the one containing the fatal dose.</p>

<p>The latter she had swallowed in ignorance because
of a headache, death ensuing in a few seconds, and
the post-mortem revealed nothing.</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear F&eacute;odor, that girl knew far too much!
Besides, we discovered that, though she had been sent
by our friend Azef to assist two of our friends to bring
'Krivochein's' career to a sudden end, she had actually
warned him, so that he has succeeded in escaping to
America to avoid us!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">scandal and blackmail</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the power of the monk Rasputin increased, so also
my own social position became advanced, until as the
"saint's" confidential secretary, and therefore as one
who had his ear, I became on friendly terms with half
the nobility of Petrograd.</p>

<p>The pious fraud declared to true believers, "If you
do not heed me, then God will abandon you."</p>

<p>Leading as he was, freely and openly, a life of
shameless debauchery, wholesale blackmail and political
intrigue, it is marvellous how his power became so un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>limited.
To those who disbelieved in his doctrine or
in his divinity, he simply smiled evilly, and said: "If
you fail to do my bidding you will be punished by
my friends."</p>

<p>Such warning was sufficient. Everyone knew that
Rasputin's power was already, in 1912, greater than
that of the Tsar Nicholas himself. Day after day
ambitious men called at the house in the Gorokhovaya,
to which we had now moved, all of them anxious for
ministerial and clerical appointments, which he obtained
for them at prices fixed by himself. The highest in the
land bowed before the rascal, while any man who dared
to belittle him, or attempt to thwart his evil designs,
was at once removed from office. Through Madame
Vyrubova, who received her share of the spoils and
acted upon the Empress, Rasputin reigned as Tsar,
the Emperor doing little but sign his name to documents
placed before him.</p>

<p>Thus Russia was compelled to witness a regular procession
of officials whom the "man of God" appointed,
in accordance with value received. Even Goremykin was
compelled to bow before the mystic humbug. Rasputin
for five years caused to be appointed or dismissed all
the bishops, and woe betide any person who attempted
to interfere with his power.</p>

<p>The Archbishop Theophanus, full of remorse at having
lent a helping hand to the scoundrel, tried to overthrow
him by publicly denouncing his evil practices, while the
Bishop Hermogenes, who knew of the monk's past,
attempted to reveal it. In an instant the vengeance of
Rasputin fell upon them, Theophanus being sent to
Tadriz, and Hermogenes confined to a monastery. Helidor
was hunted by the police and sought asylum abroad;
while a man named Grinevitch, who had also known
Rasputin long ago at Pokrovsky, was invited to dinner
by the monk one night, and next morning was found
dead in his bed; while another was arrested by the police
on a false charge of conspiracy, and sent to prison for
ten years, though perfectly innocent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
Rasputin's overbearing insolence knew no bounds.
Now that he was the power behind the Throne, he
compelled all to bow to him, the educated as well as the
peasantry. On entering a house, whether that of prince
or peasant, he would invariably kiss the young and
pretty women, while he would turn his back upon and
refuse even to speak with those who were older.</p>

<p>Our new house was larger and more luxurious than
the old one. But it also had the false telephone in the
study, which was supposed by the "saint's" dupes to
be a private wire to the palace of Tsarskoe-Selo! The
house had been furnished entirely at the expense of the
Empress, with valuable Eastern carpets, fine furniture,
tasteful hangings of silk, beautiful pictures, autographed
portraits of their Majesties, and, of course, ikons of all
sorts and sizes to impress the pious.</p>

<p>An example of the rogue's impudence occurred on
Easter Day in 1912. We were breakfasting with
Madame Vyrubova's sister at her house just off the
Nevski. With us was Boris St&uuml;rmer and two minor
officials of the Court, and we were awaiting the coming
of the Tsaritza's favourite lady in waiting.</p>

<p>At last she arrived from Tsarskoe-Selo bearing a
parcel for Grichka, which she gave him merrily, saying:</p>

<p>"The Empress has made this for you with her own
hands. She spent part of last night in finishing it for
you, so that you should have it as an Easter present."</p>

<p>The "saint" cut the string and withdrew a blue silk
coat of the kind he was in the habit of wearing, in the
Russian style, over loose trousers and high boots of
patent leather.</p>

<p>"Alix wishes you to wear it to-day," Madame Vyrubova
went on, "after you have taken Holy Communion."</p>

<p>Rasputin, with a disappointed look, cast it and its
paper upon the floor, and said:</p>

<p>"Now let us have breakfast," and promptly began
to eat with his fingers, as he always did, in order to
show his contempt for the more refined manners of
those about him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
A few weeks after this incident there occurred the
Ganskau affair, which was a most disgraceful transaction,
and which was very carefully hushed up. Though there
were many rumours in Petrograd concerning it, I am
able to place the whole of the astounding facts on record
here for the first time.</p>

<p>Rasputin, tiring of his lascivious pleasures, also
became bored by those who called in order to enlist his
influence in their cause for monetary consideration. Hence
he surrounded himself with a trio of expert swindlers.
They consisted of a certain adventurous prince named
Gorianoff, a man named Striaptchef&mdash;who had been his
companion in his early horse-stealing days in his native
Pokrovsky&mdash;and a notorious woman named Sabler. These
precious persons constituted a sort of bodyguard, and
they first interviewed any petitioner, fixed the amount
of the gift proposed to the "holy man" for the exercise
of his influence, and carried out the "deal."</p>

<p>If a wealthy man desired a Government appointment;
if an under-secretary desired a portfolio; if a wife desired
her husband's advancement or his appointment to an
office at Court; if a father desired a lucrative job for his
profligate son; or if a rich man, who was being watched
by the police because of some crime he had committed,
wished to escape scot-free, then they interviewed the
elegant Prince Gorianoff at his house in the Zacharievskaya.
This individual, whom the police of Europe know
as a Continental swindler, would quickly gauge the
petitioner's means, and screw from him every rouble
possible before putting the matter before the caster out
of devils.</p>

<p>One day, as I sat alone at lunch with Rasputin,
the prince called, and sitting down at the table unceremoniously
declared:</p>

<p>"I have done a very good stroke of business this
morning, my dear Gregory. You have probably heard
of Ganskau of Tver."</p>

<p>"The great banker, eh?"</p>

<p>"The same. He is one of the wealthiest men in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
Russia. He wants something, and he can afford to pay,
though he seems very close-fisted at present."</p>

<p>"What does he want?" growled the monk.</p>

<p>The scoundrel who bore the title of prince made a
grimace, and said:</p>

<p>"He wants to put a suggestion before you. He
refuses to tell me what it is&mdash;except that it is very
urgent and brooks no delay. I told him that he would
have to pay five thousand roubles if he desired to have
an interview&mdash;and he has paid it. Here is the money!"
And he drew from his pocket a bundle of banknotes.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Peter," exclaimed the pious fraud,
"I have no time to barter with these people. I cannot
see him."</p>

<p>"Take my advice, Gregory, and listen to what he
has to say," replied the adventurer, who had lived all
his life on his wits in London, Paris and Rome&mdash;and had
lived well too. "If I am not mistaken he will tell you
a strange thing, and if you get it down in writing&mdash;in
writing, remember&mdash;that letter will be worth a very large
sum of money in the near future. As I have said&mdash;he
wants something urgently&mdash;and he must be made to pay."</p>

<p>"Very well," Rasputin replied grudgingly. "I will
see him&mdash;at four o'clock this afternoon. F&eacute;odor," he
added, turning to me, "make a note that I see this
banker man."</p>

<p>At four o'clock punctually a fine car drew up, and
a stout, overdressed, full-bearded man alighted and was
shown into the room where I awaited him with the
prince.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the latter, welcoming him warmly. "You
had my message over the telephone. I have, after great
difficulty, induced the holy Father to consent to see you.
He is due at Tsarskoe-Selo, but he has just telephoned
to the Empress that he is delayed. And the delay is
in order to hear you."</p>

<p>"I am sure I am most grateful, Prince," declared
the banker, who seemed very pale and much agitated.
His wealth was proverbial in Russia, and even in banking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
circles in Paris and London. His brother was one of
the secretaries of the Russian Embassy in Paris.</p>

<p>With due ceremony, after the banker had removed
his <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lght'">light</ins> overcoat, I conducted him into the monk's
presence.</p>

<p>As Ganskau bowed towards the mysterious influence
behind the Imperial Throne, I saw the quick, inquisitive
hawk's glance which Rasputin gave him. Then I turned
and, closing the door, left the pair together, and returned
to where the prince was waiting. Gorianoff was a clever
and unscrupulous scoundrel of exquisite manners and
most plausible tongue. It was for that reason that the
holy Father employed him.</p>

<p>As he leaned back in a padded arm-chair, smoking
lazily while he awaited his victim's reappearance, he
laughed merrily and whispered to me that the rich man
from Tver would, "if properly handled," prove a gold
mine.</p>

<p>"Mind, F&eacute;odor&mdash;be careful to impress upon the
Father to obtain something incriminating from the banker
in writing. He is hard pressed, I know, and in order to
save himself he will commit any folly."</p>

<p>"Men who are pushed into a corner seldom pause
to think," I remarked.</p>

<p>"If the police are upon them, as I know they are in
this case, then no time is afforded for reflection."</p>

<p>By the prince's manner I knew that he felt confident
of making big profits. The great Ganskau, the Rothschild
of Russia, desired Gregory's aid, and Gregory
would assist him&mdash;at a price. While we were talking
Madame Vyrubova rang on the telephone to inquire if
Rasputin had left for Tsarskoe-Selo.</p>

<p>I replied in the negative, whereupon she said: "Tell
him not to come to-night. The Emperor has quarrelled
with Alix, and it will be best for him to be absent.
The boy [meaning the little Tsarevitch] will be taken
ill in the night, and then he can come to-morrow and
heal him."</p>

<p>I understood. The woman Vyrubova, so trusted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
the Tsaritza, was about to administer another dose of
that baneful drug to the poor invalid boy&mdash;a drug which
would produce partial paralysis, combined with symptoms
which puzzled every physician called to see him.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly half an hour later that
Rasputin opened the door of his room, and, crossing
himself piously, laid his hands upon his breast and
dismissed his petitioner.</p>

<p>"Your desire shall be granted," he said in final
farewell. "But you must write me the reason you desire
my assistance. I always insist upon that in every case."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;well, it is not nice to confess," declared the
desperate man, pausing on the threshold of the room.</p>

<p>"Probably not. But you do confess to me, and
surely you can trust me, a servant of Heaven, with
your secret? If not, please do not rely upon Gregory
Rasputin," he added proudly.</p>

<p>For a second the victim hesitated. Then he said in
a low, hard voice: "I will do as you wish&mdash;well knowing
that you will keep the truth a secret."</p>

<p>Rasputin, his hands still crossed upon his breast,
bowed stiffly, and the banker, recognising us standing
at the end of the passage, walked towards us.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left the house, Rasputin called
us, and throwing himself into a chair became unduly
hilarious.</p>

<p>"Really, Peter, you are extremely clever!" he declared.
"Where you find these people I do not know.
You said you had done a good stroke of business, but
I did not believe you. Yet now I see that the banker's
millions of roubles are entirely at our disposal. We
must be diplomatic&mdash;that is all!"</p>

<p>"Why does he require your influence?" inquired
the prince.</p>

<p>"In order to extricate himself from a very dangerous
position. At any moment he may be arrested for
murder!"</p>

<p>"For murder!" Gorianoff echoed. "Is he guilty
of murder?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
"Yes. He has confessed the truth to me as a father
confessor. Now he has promised to put his confession
down in black and white."</p>

<p>In an instant I saw the trend of Rasputin's evil
thoughts. By the written confession he would, through
his princely friend, be able to extort money without
limit.</p>

<p>"Of what is he in fear?" asked the prince eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of arrest for the murder of a young French girl,
Elise Allain, who had been singing at the Bouffes in
Moscow," Rasputin replied. "He has just told me how
he committed the crime three months ago, in order to
rid himself of her, and escaped to Brussels believing
that the police would never be able to establish his
guilt. On his return to Tver three days ago, however,
he found that the police had been making active inquiries,
having discovered in one of the dead girl's trunks that
had been left at the station cloak-room in Warsaw, certain
letters from him. Indeed, he has received a visit from
the Chief of Police at Tver, who closely questioned him."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then he may be arrested at any moment&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"That is what he anticipates," said the monk. "He
has gone to his hotel to write his confession, and will
return here in an hour with a banker's draft for one
hundred thousand roubles."</p>

<p>"Did I not say that I had been doing some good
business, Gregory?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and it will prove better business later&mdash;you
will see."</p>

<p>At Rasputin's orders I went round to Malinovsky,
Assistant Director of Police, who at the monk's request
telephoned to Tver to inquire what suspicions there were
against the banker Ganskau. When Malinovsky returned
to where I was sitting, he told me that the reply of the
Chief of Police of Tver was to the effect that there
was no doubt that Ganskau was guilty of a very brutal
murder, committed in most mysterious circumstances.
The banker's wife, with whom he lived on very disagreeable
terms, had discovered a letter from the girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
Elise, and duly handed it to the police out of revenge.
This led them to find the box at Warsaw wherein were
other letters, one of which forbade her to come to Russia,
and threatening her with violence if she disobeyed.</p>

<p>I returned at once to the Gorokhovaya, where the
monk and the prince sat with a bottle of champagne
between them, and gave them the message.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the banker returned excitedly,
and was ushered in to Rasputin, who saw him
alone. They remained together for about ten minutes,
and then the victim departed.</p>

<p>At once the monk came to us, waving in one hand
Ganskau's confession of guilt, and in the other a draft
on the Azov Bank for one hundred thousand roubles.</p>

<p>"I suppose we had better pretend to do something&mdash;eh,
Peter?" asked the monk, with an evil grin.</p>

<p>"Of course," was the reply.</p>

<p>Then I sat down, and at the "holy man's" dictation
wrote to the Minister of the Interior as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is a charge of murder against Nicholas Ganskau,
banker, of Tver. I wish to see all documents concerning the
crime. Orders must be given not to arrest the assassin for
one month, and that due notice be given me before any
action is taken."</p></div>

<p>To this the monk scrawled his illiterate signature.</p>

<p>From that moment the unfortunate banker was irretrievably
in Rasputin's hands, and I saw much of his
dealings with him. Pretending to leave everything with
his friend Prince Gorianoff, he refused to see the guilty
man again. In the meantime the prince, whom I accompanied
as the monk's secretary, went to Tver three
weeks after the first transaction, and we saw the victim
in secret. Gorianoff told him that, although the monk
had been able to prevent his arrest, the police were not
satisfied, and pressure was being placed upon them by
one of his enemies in high places.</p>

<p>This, of course, greatly alarmed him.</p>

<p>"All is unfortunately due to your wife!" the prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
remarked. "It is a pity you have not made peace with her.
It was she who took one of the girl's letters to the police."</p>

<p>The banker started up as though electrified.</p>

<p>"My wife!" he gasped. "Is it her doing?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," was the prince's cool reply.
"F&eacute;odor knows it. He had it from the Chief of Police
of this city himself."</p>

<p>I confirmed my companion's statement, while the
banker, terror and despair written upon his pale features,
stood staring like one who saw death before him.</p>

<p>"My wife left me a fortnight ago!" he stammered.
"That is why. She expected me to be arrested. What
can I do? How can you help me? Who is this enemy
in a high position who is determined upon my arrest?"</p>

<p>"The holy Father alone knows; I do not," declared
the prince very seriously. "It is somebody at Court&mdash;somebody
who is a friend of his and who let the fact
drop in the course of conversation. I regret it, but I
may as well tell you that your arrest is imminent."</p>

<p>"But what can I do to avoid the scandal?" cried the
murderer in despair.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the only way is to propitiate your unknown
enemy," replied the prince insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"I gave the Father a hundred thousand roubles,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"True; and the Father used his influence so that
the inquiries were dropped. He had no knowledge of
the fact that you had such a bitter and relentless enemy
in the higher Court circle."</p>

<p>"Nor had I. I wonder who it can be&mdash;except, perhaps,
Boyadko, with whom I once had some financial
dealings over which we quarrelled."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the unknown enemy only existed
in Rasputin's fertile imagination.</p>

<p>"Well, as I have said, the Father may find means
of propitiating him&mdash;if the payment is a liberal one,"
said Gorianoff. "I suggest that you return with us to
Petrograd at once, and I will endeavour to accomplish
something."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
Eagerly he acted upon the adventurer's advice. During
the journey the banker was nervous lest at any moment
the police might lay hands upon him. At each station
the sight of a grey uniform caused him to hold his
breath. Thus to work upon his nerves was part of
the prince's game, for he well knew that the more
terrified Ganskau became, the greater amount of money
he would be prepared to pay.</p>

<p>Back in Petrograd he begged of Rasputin to receive
him, and the monk, after two refusals on the plea that
he was too busy, at last consented ungraciously.</p>

<p>The result of that interview was that Nicholas
Ganskau disgorged a further hundred thousand roubles
for the bribing of an enemy who did not exist!</p>

<p>After the banker had left, Rasputin, full of satisfaction
as he held the draft for the amount in his dirty
paw, dictated to me another letter addressed to the
Minister of the Interior, which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His Majesty the Emperor, having full knowledge of the
charge of murder made against Nicholas Ganskau of Tver,
orders that the inquiries concerning the case be abandoned
and that the person suspected be not further molested."</p></div>

<p>This was duly signed by the monk and delivered by
me at the Ministry an hour later.</p>

<p>Such orders Rasputin frequently gave in the name
of His Majesty, who, even if he knew of them, never
questioned them.</p>

<p>This, however, did not end the affair, for twelve
months afterwards Ganskau, who, scot-free, had taken
up his residence in the Avenue Villiers, in Paris, where
he was leading a very gay life, received an unexpected
visit from Prince Gorianoff, who, making pretence that
he had severed his friendship with Rasputin, hinted that
as the monk held in his possession the written confession
of his crime, it might be worth while to obtain
and destroy it.</p>

<p>This suggestion Ganskau at once welcomed, thanking
the prince for his kindly intervention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
Then the latter made a remark which in itself showed
how expert a blackmailer he was.</p>

<p>"You see, as the girl Elise was a French subject,
if the French police ever get hold of the truth it would
go very badly with you," he declared.</p>

<p>The banker's face went pale as death.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that!" he gasped. "Yes, I
must get that confession at all hazards," he cried.</p>

<p>"I am prepared to assist you," said the scoundrel
coolly. "Of course to obtain it from such a man as
Rasputin presents many difficulties. He will never part
with it willingly."</p>

<p>"Then how shall we get it?"</p>

<p>"It must be stolen."</p>

<p>The banker remained silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>"You see," went on the prince, "one can never tell
into whose hands may fall that collection of confessions
which the Father has extracted from those who
are guilty."</p>

<p>"And you think you can obtain it for me?" asked
the banker.</p>

<p>"I am still friendly with many of Rasputin's friends.
It is merely a matter of payment&mdash;another hundred
thousand roubles, and surely it is worth it."</p>

<p>The banker, seeing himself in great danger should
either Rasputin or his visitor turn against him, at length
consented, and before Gorianoff left he had in his pocket
a draft upon the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais for the sum mentioned.
The assassin had at first made it a condition that the
confession should be handed to him before he paid,
but the prince pointed out that the money was required
for bribery, and would have to be paid before
the confession could be extracted from Rasputin's
safe.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the banker never received back his
written confession of his crime, and so constant was
the strain of his guilty conscience and his hourly dread
of arrest and capital punishment, that a year later he
shot himself at an hotel in Plymouth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
Another illustration of the monk's greed and unscrupulousness
was the Violle affair.</p>

<p>Monsieur Felix Violle, a Frenchman who had become
a naturalised Russian, and who carried on business as a
wholesale furrier in the Nevski in Petrograd, had a very
pretty young wife. One day, at one of the weekly
reunions of the sister-disciples, this young woman was
brought by Madame Vyrubova's sister, she having expressed
her desire to enter Rasputin's cult. There were
present on that occasion about thirty other women,
mostly young and good-looking, and nearly all of the
highest society in Petrograd. The youngest present was
about seventeen, the daughter of a certain countess who
was one of Rasputin's most attached devotees.</p>

<p>After Madame Violle had been initiated into the
secrets of the erotic sect, the whole party sat down to
tea, when a photograph was taken by one of the ladies,
which showed Madame Violle seated by the "holy
Father."</p>

<p>Rasputin, from that day, took a great deal of interest
in the furrier's wife. He introduced her to Anna Vyrubova,
who presented her to the Empress. Hence, from
being a tradesman's wife, Olga Violle, within a fortnight,
had entered the vicious Court circle which revolved around
Alexandra Feodorovna, and which was rapidly conspiring
to betray Russia into the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>Madame Violle told her husband nothing of her social
advancement. The furrier was in a large way of business,
a man of means who liked to see his wife well dressed;
therefore she was able to cut an elegant figure at Court.
She accounted for her absences from home by the fact
that she frequently visited a married sister living about
twenty miles outside Petrograd.</p>

<p>Under the evil hypnotic influence of Rasputin, the
smart little woman, who often called at the house and
whom I sometimes met at the palace, was quickly
transformed from a steady tradesman's wife into a giddy,
pleasure-loving and intriguing degenerate, perhaps even
more vicious than the rest. Indeed, it was this very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
fact which caused the Empress to look upon her with
favour. Thus she soon had the run of the private
apartments, and became upon friendly terms with both
St&uuml;rmer and Fredericks.</p>

<p>This went on for some months, and even at the
Imperial Court, where nobody was over-squeamish, the
conduct of little Madame Violle&mdash;who came from nowhere
and whose past was quite obscure except to Rasputin,
Madame Vyrubova, her sister and myself&mdash;was looked
upon somewhat askance.</p>

<p>Violle, who was most devoted to his extremely pretty
wife, one day had a sudden shock. By some means a
copy of the photograph of the sister-disciples went astray
in the post. A photographer obtained possession of it
and promptly made some picture post-cards, which were
quickly upon the market, much to Rasputin's chagrin.
Somebody, recognising Madame Violle in the picture,
sent one anonymously to her husband. The result was
a terrible domestic scene.</p>

<p>Madame Olga came to Rasputin in great distress,
and in my presence, falling upon her knees before him,
in tears, kissed his unwashed hands and begged him
to advise her.</p>

<p>"Your precious husband has made a fool of himself,"
the monk remarked grimly. "Let him take warning
lest Gregory Rasputin lift his hand against him. Return
home, and tell him that from me."</p>

<p>That was all the advice he would give her. He was
full of anger that the woman who had taken the picture
should have been so negligent as to allow a copy to
fall into the hands of others. Always elusive, he hated
to be photographed, as he feared that it might constitute
evidence against him.</p>

<p>The pretty woman, still much agitated, went out,
and took train to Tsarskoe-Selo, where she had audience
of Her Majesty, who, in turn, urged her to defy her
husband.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the latter was going about Petrograd in
a state of fury at discovering that his wife was one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
the monk's followers. But he was not the first furious
husband who had had cause to hate the hypnotic peasant.
The man Striaptchef and the woman Sabler, who constituted
Rasputin's bodyguard, assisted by Prince
Gorianoff, quickly heard of the furrier's anger and told
the monk. Therefore it was not with any degree of
surprise that, when a ring came at the door late that
same night, I found myself face to face with the
wronged husband.</p>

<p>"I wish to see the Father," he said quite coolly.</p>

<p>"I regret that he is out," was my prompt reply.</p>

<p>"You lie!" he shouted. "He is at home. This
house has been watched ever since six o'clock, when he
returned. I will see him, and you dare not stop me."</p>

<p>Then, ere I was aware of it, he seized me by the
throat, hurled me back into the entrance-hall, and before
I could prevent him marched straight to Rasputin's
room.</p>

<p>I dashed after him, hearing the monk's shouts for
assistance, and on entering found the "holy man" lying
on the floor and the infuriated Violle lashing him with a
short whip he carried. The scene was a dramatic
one. The scoundrel was shrieking with pain, and in
endeavouring to avoid the blows succeeded in rising, but
as he did so the furrier administered another sound
whack, which sent the Empress's pet "saint" skipping
across the room howling.</p>

<p>"You dog of a mock monk!" cried the furrier.
"Take that!&mdash;and that!&mdash;<i>and that!</i>"</p>

<p>So beside himself with anger was he that I believe he
would have beaten Rasputin to death had not Striaptchef
dashed in, and together we succeeded in dragging the
angry man off and turning him out of the house.</p>

<p>As soon as the "saint" had recovered from the <i>fracas</i>,
he gave vent to a volley of fearful oaths, cursing the
pretty woman who had been the cause of the assault.</p>

<p>"She shall be kicked out. I will see that she goes
to the palace no more," he declared. "If a woman cannot
manage her husband then she is dangerous. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
Olga Violle has proved herself to be dangerous. I will
see that Alix dismisses her to-morrow. And all on
account of that thrice-accursed picture-making. To think
that I&mdash;the Saviour of Russia, sent to these people by
the Almighty&mdash;should be whipped like a dog!"</p>

<p>He strode up and down foaming with fury.</p>

<p>"The skin-dealer shall suffer!" he cried. "I'll make
him pay dearly for this!"</p>

<p>Then, turning to me, he ordered me to go at once to
Manuiloff, St&uuml;rmer's secretary, adding: "Bring him to
me. Tell him that it is a matter of greatest urgency."</p>

<p>I had great difficulty in finding the man he had indicated,
and who was one of Russia's "dark forces."
He was not at his house, but by bribing the doorkeeper
I learned that he would be found in a very questionable
gambling-house in the vicinity. There I discovered him
and drove him to the Gorokhovaya.</p>

<p>"Listen," the monk said as I ushered him in. "There
is a furrier in the Nevski named Violle. Both he and
his wife are dangerous revolutionists and must be arrested
at once. You understand&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Manuiloff, the catspaw of both St&uuml;rmer and Rasputin,
and who was well paid to do any dirty work allotted to
him, did not quite understand.</p>

<p>"You denounce him&mdash;eh?" he asked. "There are
reasons, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course there are reasons, you fool, or I should
not bring you here at this hour to tell you of the conspiracy
against the Throne. I make the allegation; you
must furnish the proofs. Do you now understand?"
asked the "saint."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see! You want some documents introduced
into the furrier's house incriminating both him and his
wife?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And at once. They must both be arrested
before noon to-morrow," Rasputin said. "I shall leave
all the details to you, well knowing that they will be in
good hands, my dear Manuiloff," laughed Rasputin
grimly. "One thing is important. There must be no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
loophole for either of them to escape. The Empress wills
it so. Both must be sent to Schl&uuml;sselburg. Tell His
Excellency so from me. We want no trial or attempt at
scandal. The pair are dangerous&mdash;dangerous to us.
Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>Manuiloff, who had forged incriminating documents
many times, and who had a dozen underlings who assisted
him in these nefarious deeds, understood perfectly. He
was paid to act as his two chiefs directed, and dozens
of innocent persons were rotting in prison at that moment
because they had fallen beneath Rasputin's displeasure.</p>

<p>So it was that by noon next day both Violle and his
pretty wife&mdash;who had only the day before been a close
friend of the Tsaritza&mdash;were on their way to Schl&uuml;sselburg
as dangerous to the State.</p>

<p>Truly, the monk had neither scruples nor honesty,
neither compunction nor pity; for the woman who was
his favourite he had turned upon and sent to that grim
island fortress, where in one of those terrible oubliettes
below the level of the lake her death took place eight
months later.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">rasputin the actual tsar</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tragi-comedy of Tsarskoe-Selo was being played
with increasing vigour just prior to the war. Berlin,
through Rasputin, piped the tune to which the Imperial
Court was dancing&mdash;the Dance of Death!</p>

<p>One night, after Rasputin had dined with Madame
Vyrubova and myself, General Soukhomlinoff, Minister of
War, entered, swaggering in the uniform of the Grodno
Hussars.</p>

<p>This man, who, as I write, is in a convict prison as a
traitor, had only a week before assured the Emperor that
the army was ready "to the last button" for a possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
war, and the troops devoted to him. I happen to know
how many thousand roubles passed into his banking
account from the Deutsche Bank in Berlin as price of
that lie!</p>

<p>Poor weak Nicholas! On the day following, Protopopoff,
the wily schemer and spy of Germany, who was
admitted to all the secrets of the Allies, went to the
Emperor and echoed what Rasputin had declared to His
Majesty, namely, that God was with Russia and that the
Holy Spirit approved of the righteous work accomplished
under the guidance of St&uuml;rmer and Soukhomlinoff. Truly
the camarilla were supporting each other, and I, an onlooker,
stood amazed and astounded. All four were half-mad
with wild dreams of the prosperity which war would
bring to them, for the bribes promised by Berlin were
heavy, and Hardt and other secret messengers were constantly
passing between the two capitals bearing confidential
orders from the Wilhelmstrasse, of which the
War Minister's assurance to the Tsar had been one.</p>

<p>But Soukhomlinoff, whose wife was declared to be the
most <i>chic</i> and extravagant woman in all Petrograd,
strode up and down the room that night in a fury of
rage.</p>

<p>"Gregory!" he cried. "An untoward incident has
happened. Your enemy Vorontsof Dachkof has been at
work against you this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Curse him! How?" growled the monk, for the
Lieutenant-General of the Caucasus had been a personal
friend of Alexander III.</p>

<p>"I was at audience with Nicholas after luncheon, and
the count was there. After he had presented his report
he became familiar, and said: 'Now I must talk to thee.
Dost thou know that, with thy Rasputin fellows, thou art
going to thy doom, that thou art gambling away thy
throne and the life of thy child?'"</p>

<p>"What?" gasped the monk, starting up. "Did he
openly say that?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Then the count shall be disgraced!" declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
Rasputin. "He has long been my enemy; but I will
suffer this no longer."</p>

<p>"Well, when the count spoke, Nicholas huddled himself
up on a settee and sobbed. 'Oh! why did God
confide to me this heavy task!'"</p>

<p>"The fool!" laughed Rasputin. "To-morrow he shall
see me playing with the Tsarevitch in the Park, and
Nicholas shall be with us."</p>

<p>And indeed Rasputin carried out his plan, and the
count saw them together.</p>

<p>The monk was not blind to the fact that he was
surrounded by enemies, all of whom were jealous of his
power and sought his downfall. By bribery, blackmail,
and the unscrupulous use of the secret police, which was
under Protopopoff as Minister of the Interior, the
camarilla were waxing fat, and woe betide any who dared
utter a warning to the Emperor.</p>

<p>Monsieur Gutchkoff had denounced, before the Duma,
the scandal of the sexually-perverted peasant's presence
at Court and prophesied the direct disaster. Kokovtsov
had loyally warned his master of the effect upon the
country which the low intrigues of his courtiers was
producing. Then, when Goremykin urged the Tsar to
prorogue the Duma, General Polivanof had the courage
to sign an address to His Majesty urging him not to
do so, as it would be a highly dangerous measure.
Rodzianko, too, regardless of consequences, took to
Tsarskoe-Selo a full report of the accusations made in
the Duma, and urged His Majesty to put an end to
the outrageous scandals.</p>

<p>The monk had noted all this, and had already marked
down all his enemies for destruction. He well knew
what aversion the Tsar had to anyone who spoke what
was unwelcome. Weak and vacillating, His Majesty hated
to be told the plain truth, and for that reason he was
so constantly kept in the dark. Even his loyal Ministers
knew that by being outspoken they would be seeking
dismissal. Indeed, with Rasputin's clever intriguing,
Kokovtsov, Sazonov, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Kirovchein'">Krivochein</ins> and Polivanof all paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
for their sincerity by the loss of their offices and the
displeasure of their Imperial master. Again, it was the
monk who had contrived to dismiss Monsieur Trepof,
for I actually wrote out the order, which Nicholas signed,
dismissing him! And, in addition, Rodzianko, whom
the Emperor nicknamed "the Archdeacon" because of
his deep, impressive voice, lost the sympathy of his
sovereign because he had prophesied evil.</p>

<p>And now yet another enemy had arisen in the person
of Count Vorontsof Dachkof.</p>

<p>"The count shall pay for this, and dearly!" repeated
Rasputin, as he sat with his brows knit, stroking his
unkempt beard.</p>

<p>"At least he can be dismissed, just as you sent into
disgrace Prince Orlof, the fidus Achates of the Emperor,"
remarked Anna Vyrubova, who was handsomely dressed
and wearing some fine diamonds.</p>

<p>Rasputin gave vent to an evil laugh.</p>

<p>"And Witte also," he said. Then, with his unbounded
egotism he rose, and added: "Yes, Anna, I
am Tsar, though Nicholas bears the title!"</p>

<p>Only on the previous night the Tsar, accompanied
by Soukhomlinoff and Rasputin, had dined at the mess
of the officers of the Guard, and all three, His Majesty
included, had become highly hilarious, and later on
hopelessly drunk.</p>

<p>"True!" exclaimed the Minister of War, who had
so misled Russia and the Tsar into a belief that all was
prepared for hostilities against Germany. "You are the
most powerful person in the land to-day, Gregory. That
is why you must not only suppress Vorontsof Dachkof,
but also Yakowleff&mdash;who is his friend, remember."</p>

<p>"Ah, Yakowleff! I had quite forgotten, General!
How foolish of me!" cried the monk. "The concession
for the gambling casino at Otchakov has been granted
to him, but we must have it. It will be a second Monte
Carlo, and a mine of wealth for us."</p>

<p>"I quite agree, my dear Gregory. And it lies entirely
with you whether we stand in Yakowleff's place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
or not," exclaimed the woman who was the evil genius
of the Tsaritza.</p>

<p>The fact was that a rich financier, Ivan Yakowleff,
who had offices in Petrograd and in London, for certain
personal services rendered to the Tsar&mdash;the buying off
of an unwelcome female entanglement, it is said&mdash;had
been granted a concession to establish public gaming-rooms
at Otchakov, on the Black Sea, not far from
Odessa. The financier, who was elderly, had recently
married a young and rather pretty wife, and being a
friend of Count Vorontsof Dachkof, was in the happiest
circumstances, well knowing that a huge fortune
awaited him.</p>

<p>"At the moment Yakowleff is in London, I hear,
forming a syndicate to take over the concession," the
general remarked.</p>

<p>Rasputin smiled evilly, and after a pause said:</p>

<p>"Anybody who puts money into the venture will never
see that money again. I will take care of that."</p>

<p>"Good!" laughed His Excellency the Minister, flicking
some dust from the sleeve of his uniform. "We
must have that concession for ourselves. But ought not
we to know what is in progress in London&mdash;eh? Shall
we get Protopopoff to send instructions to his agents
in England?"</p>

<p>"No. Something might leak out. I do not trust the
Okhrana in London," replied the wary woman, Vyrubova.
"Have you forgotten the Meadows affair, and how they
betrayed me and very nearly caused a scandal by their
bungling? No, if we are to watch Yakowleff, let us
do it ourselves. Why should you not go, F&eacute;odor?" she
suggested, suddenly turning to me.</p>

<p>"I? To London!" I exclaimed, in no way averse
to the journey, for I had been in England on three
occasions previously.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rasputin. "You shall go. Start to-morrow.
Telegraph to Madame Huguet. She will help
you, for she is not suspected, and all believe her to be
French. Besides, she is pretty, and therefore useful."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
"As a decoy, you mean?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of what other use is a woman?" laughed the
scoundrel, whose unscrupulousness where the fair sex
were concerned was notorious. He rose, and, unlocking
a drawer, took out a book in which were registered
many addresses of those who were in his pay, and
hence under his thraldom.</p>

<p>I searched the pages eagerly and found the address,
together with notes of certain payments. Madame, I
saw, lived in a flat in Harrington Gardens, South
Kensington.</p>

<p>There and then I received instructions to leave next
day by the through express to Ostend, seek the lady, and
then watch the movements of the Russian, who was busily
forming the syndicate for the new Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>"If we are to strike against him we cannot know
too much of his doings. Besides, when we do strike
we must not blunder&mdash;eh, General?" laughed the monk,
after which he opened a bottle of champagne, of which
we all drank.</p>

<p>A week later I was in London, and one afternoon
called upon Madame Huguet, who was expecting me.
She was a vivacious, dark-haired young Frenchwoman,
who had been one of the Father's sister-disciples in
Petrograd, and whom he had sent to London upon some
secret mission, the purpose of which was not quite clear
to me. She had lived for some years in London before,
and was well known in certain go-ahead circles of society.
Seated in her cosy, well furnished drawing-room, with
its silken curtains and bright chintzes in the English
style, I told her exactly what Rasputin and Anna had
instructed me to say.</p>

<p>"The Father wishes you to lose no time in becoming
acquainted with the financier Yakowleff," I said. "He
has offices in Old Broad Street, and he lives in Fitzjohn's
Avenue, Hampstead, when in London."</p>

<p>"He is there now," she said. "I saw something
about him in the papers three days ago&mdash;something
concerning a concession for a gaming casino."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
"Oh!" I cried. "Then it is in the papers&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>She obtained the copy of the newspaper, and I saw
it was announced that an "Establishment" was about to
be constructed at Otchakov, which was to be a formidable
rival to Monte Carlo, and that Monsieur Yakowleff,
of Petrograd, was the originator of the scheme.</p>

<p>Fortunately Yakowleff did not know me by sight;
therefore, while Madame Huguet set to work to scrape
acquaintance with him, I spent my days watching his
movements when he came to his City office, and noting
his constant and busy peregrinations to and fro. Certainly
his scheme was attracting around him many
influential and wealthy men, to whom the prospect of
huge profits proved alluring.</p>

<p>He was short, stout, rather Hebrew in appearance,
unscrupulous no doubt, or he would not have stooped
to do such dirty work as he did for Nicholas; nevertheless,
he seemed highly popular in financial circles. He
had left his wife in Petrograd; therefore the life he was
leading was, I found, a pretty gay one. Each day he
lunched at the best restaurants with his business friends,
and discussed the great Otchakov scheme, and each night
he took one of his lady friends out to dinner, the theatre,
and the Savoy, Ritz or Carlton afterwards.</p>

<p>Within ten days of my arrival in London I found
that his guest at dinner at the Ritz one night was the
sprightly young Frenchwoman, Julie Huguet!</p>

<p>Next day she called me by telephone to Harrington
Gardens, and said:</p>

<p>"I discovered a good deal last night. The syndicate
is already formed. One hundred thousand pounds has
been subscribed, and next week Yakowleff is leaving for
Paris, and thence back to Petrograd."</p>

<p>Within half an hour I had telegraphed the news to
Box 296, Poste Restante, Petrograd, which was the one
used by Rasputin.</p>

<p>In reply I received from the monk a message which
read:</p>

<p>"Obtain names of subscribers."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
This I succeeded in doing after some considerable
trouble, and they were the names of some of the shrewdest
speculators in the City, none of them over-scrupulous,
no doubt. To Rasputin I wired that I had the list, and
asked for instructions, to which I received the reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Excellent! Return without delay.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gregory.</span>"</p></div>

<p>On my way back, during those many hours in the
Nord Express between Ostend and Petrograd, I reviewed
the whole affair, and saw the sinister working of the
monk's mind. That Count Vorontsof Dachkof was in
danger I knew full well. The monk never allowed any
person to express open enmity without retaliating quietly
and patiently, but with a crushing blow.</p>

<p>I wondered what was being planned between the
Ministers of War and Interior. No doubt the Empress
had been informed of what the count had told the
Emperor, and she would at once conspire with the holy
Father to cast him into social oblivion&mdash;or worse!</p>

<p>That the cupidity of Rasputin knew no bounds I was
well aware. He intended to obtain that most lucrative
gambling concession for himself, for Russians are born
gamblers, especially the better classes, and the establishment
of a casino on the Black Sea, with French hotels
and restaurants, pretty villas, and an opera house in
imitation of Monte Carlo, would in summer attract those
thousands of rich Russians who in winter went to the
Riviera to gamble.</p>

<p>It was a chance which Rasputin would never allow
to slip. Of that I was quite certain.</p>

<p>The evening I returned to Petrograd the monk had
left me a message to go to Tsarskoe-Selo; therefore I
took my green pass, which admitted me past the many
guards of the innermost holy-of-holies, the Imperial
apartments, where I knew I should find the real ruler
of Russia.</p>

<p>He had been spending the evening with the Empress,
her daughter Olga, and Anna, and when I sent word
to him he joined me in a small ante-room, and, closing
the door, eagerly questioned me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
"When does Yakowleff return from Paris?" he asked
when I had read over to him the list of those adventurous
London financiers who had put their money into
the Otchakov scheme.</p>

<p>"Next Thursday he leaves," I said. "Madame has
gone to Paris on pretence of shopping, but in reality to
keep watch. 'Axanda, Poste Restante, Avenue de
l'Op&eacute;ra,' will find her. She arranged it with me before
we parted."</p>

<p>"Then this money-bag has really formed an influential
syndicate in London to exploit our country&mdash;eh?" asked
the monk grimly. "I have been speaking to the Empress
about it, and she declares that the whole circumstance
of Nicholas granting a concession, and for such service,
is scandalous."</p>

<p>Scandalous! Surely Alexandra Feodorovna knew that
her own actions had caused her name to be execrated
through the length and breadth of Russia. Helidor and
the "Blessed Mitia" had both attempted to reveal
what they knew. Helidor and Mitia had many powerful
friends, so they were severely left alone by the police;
yet others who but opened their mouths and criticised
had been sent to prison without trial, while those
who had gained undue knowledge and might transmit
it to England or America were sent to those dreaded
oubliettes of Schl&uuml;sselburg&mdash;worse even than the Bastille,
and not one has ever returned across the lake alive.</p>

<p>Rasputin was at that moment occupied by two
matters&mdash;first, the fierce antagonism of Vorontsof Dachkof;
and secondly, his avariciousness concerning the
concession for gambling at that pretty little town east
of Odessa.</p>

<p>So wide was the monk's influence that, hearing at
that moment that the King of the Hellenes had granted
to another British syndicate a concession to open public
gaming-tables in Corfu, Rasputin had already been to
St&uuml;rmer, the President of the Council, and contrived
to have diplomatic pressure brought through Prince
Demidoff, Russian Minister at Athens, to bear upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
King to cancel the concession as opposed to public
morals! This view Rasputin contrived to have supported
by the Wilhelmstrasse, because the Kaiser had
his spring palace in the vicinity, and, with his mock
piety, he discountenanced any Temple of Fortune. The
result was that the Corfu casino was prohibited.</p>

<p>Thus the Otchakov scheme was the only one in
Europe. San Sebastian was declared by the monk to
be only on a par with Ostend, and Otchakov was to
be the great rival of Monte Carlo, with more varied
and added attractions.</p>

<p>In that room, while he was hearing me through,
Protopopoff, who had been making a report to the
Emperor, joined us, and listened to what I had to say.</p>

<p>"I was looking at Yakowleff's <i>dossier</i> to-day, as
you wished," remarked the Minister to the monk. "He
seems a very honest, clean-living man for a financier.
There are no suspicions of disloyalty, or even of
anything."</p>

<p>"Then they must be made," declared Rasputin. "I
intend to hold that concession. He would never have
had it had it not been for Dachkof. But the latter is
already out of favour. The Emperor has promised me
to dismiss him to-morrow. His Majesty prefers cheerful
people, not men who are pessimists," he laughed.</p>

<p>Indeed, next day the count, who was one of the
most loyal and devoted servants of the Romanoffs, and
who had risked everything in an attempt to open the
Emperor's eyes, was actually dismissed. Such was the
power of Rasputin.</p>

<p>But the plot against Yakowleff to dispossess him of
the concession for Otchakov was a much more deeply-laid
and evil one. The financier had returned to Petrograd,
flushed with his success with his moneyed friends in
London. Already news had gone round that a wonderful
casino was to be built to eclipse Monte Carlo, and
he had given an interview to the <i>Novoye Vremya</i>
concerning it.</p>

<p>One afternoon, while in the handsome room set apart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
for Rasputin's use at Tsarskoe-Selo, I was sitting writing
at his dictation, when there suddenly entered the Emperor,
who had just come in from one of his frequent solitary
walks in the park.</p>

<p>His Majesty flung himself wearily in a chair, and
began to discuss a diplomatic matter concerning Austria,
and to ask the Father's advice, for he now scarcely ever
acted upon his own initiative.</p>

<p>Rasputin reflected for a few moments as he stood
gazing out of the window, and then, having given his
opinion as to the proper course to pursue, he added:</p>

<p>"There is another matter which should have thy
attention&mdash;a matter which is being hidden very carefully
from thee."</p>

<p>"And pray what is that, Father?" inquired the
Emperor.</p>

<p>"It is the secret and traitorous dealings which one
Yakowleff is having with British agents with a view to
betraying Russia into the hands of the English," declared
the sinister monk.</p>

<p>"I do not follow."</p>

<p>"To this man Yakowleff thou gavest the concession
for improvements at Otchakov. On pretence of obtaining
financial assistance he has been to London, and there,
according to what my friends tell me, has been in consultation
with certain British agents, whose intention it
is to obtain our military and naval secrets."</p>

<p>"Then you denounce Yakowleff as a traitor&mdash;eh?"
snapped the Emperor.</p>

<p>"I certainly do. If thou doubtest me, order Protopopoff
to make a police search at his house in the
Vosnesensky. Something will certainly be found there,"
he said, with insidious cunning, well knowing that Protopopoff's
<i>agents-provocateurs</i> had already taken steps to
secure the financier's undoing.</p>

<p>"I have here the names of two Englishwomen who
are in the British Secret Service, and who were recently
in Petrograd with Yakowleff." And he produced a piece
of paper upon which he had scrawled the two names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
in his illiterate calligraphy. "The women are back in
London, but he was with them a fortnight ago."</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain of all this?" asked Nicholas
dubiously. "I always believed Yakowleff to be my friend.
Indeed, he has already shown his loyalty to me."</p>

<p>"And in return thou gavest him the valuable concession
for Otchakov," growled the monk.</p>

<p>"If you assure me, Father, that what you have said
is the truth, and not mere hearsay, I will call Protopopoff,
and he shall make full inquiry."</p>

<p>"It is a pity that the Otchakov scheme should be
given into the hands of thy enemy," the monk declared,
and thus the matter dropped.</p>

<p>In Petrograd late that night, after the usual evening
assembly of the sister-disciples, when all the women had
departed and I was again alone with the monk, Protopopoff
arrived, and said jubilantly:</p>

<p>"Your words to Nicholas have borne fruit regarding
Yakowleff. The Emperor spoke to me on the telephone,
and, acting on his instructions, I ordered a police search,
when some documents in cipher were found in a drawer
in his writing-table."</p>

<p>"And you arrested him?"</p>

<p>"No. He seems to have somehow got wind of what
was in progress, for he left Petrograd yesterday for
Helsingfors, and has escaped!"</p>

<p>"Escaped!" shrieked Rasputin, springing to his feet
in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes. Gone back to London, I believe."</p>

<p>The monk knit his brows and stood stroking his
unkempt beard. He was thinking out some further
devilish plot.</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor," he said at last, turning to me, "write
down what I say."</p>

<p>I crossed to the table, and when I was ready he
dictated the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In consequence of his traitorous dealings with emissaries
of a foreign Power, I, Nicholas, refuse to grant Ivan Yakowleff
his application for a concession for improvements at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
Otchakov, and hereby grant the privilege unreservedly to
Alexander Klouieff, of 48 Kurlandskaya, Petrograd. Further,
I order the arrest of Ivan Yakowleff and the confiscation of
all his property."</p></div>

<p>Alexander Klouieff! The fellow was an ex-agent of
secret police, a man ready to do any dirty work, even
murder, for Rasputin, if paid for it&mdash;a low-bred criminal
of the worst possible type! So the concession was to
be given to him, and he, of course, would in due course,
in exchange for payment, hand it over to the monk, who
would share the huge profits with his friends.</p>

<p>"Nicholas shall sign that to-morrow," Rasputin remarked
with confidence. "As soon as he has done so
I will see that copies be sent to each of the men in
London who have subscribed, and they will no doubt
prosecute Yakowleff for fraud. In any case, he is ruined
and cast out, so he no longer stands in our path."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Protopopoff. "Does Klouieff
know?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I shall pay him something for the
use of his name before he knows exactly what has transpired,"
was the crafty reply of the "blessed Gregory"&mdash;as
so many termed him.</p>

<p>Two days later I went as usual to the palace with
my master, and he took me with him along to the
Emperor's room, in case any writing was to be done.
The monk's first words were of the escape of Yakowleff.</p>

<p>"The traitor has gone back to his English pay-masters!"
said the Starets. "I have written here the
order for his arrest and the confiscation of his property."</p>

<p>And he placed before the Emperor the document I had
written. To Rasputin's dismay, however, His Majesty
seemed disinclined to append his signature. To me,
Nicholas, who was wearing an old grey tweed suit,
seemed very doubtful regarding the whole transaction.</p>

<p>"Who is this person Alexander Klouieff?" he demanded.
"I must know something more of him."</p>

<p>"He is a man of considerable wealth&mdash;upright,
honourable, and devoted to thee," Rasputin assured him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
"Canst thou not place thy trust in those I recommend?
If not, I say no more."</p>

<p>"Of course, Father; but the concession was granted&mdash;while
this order makes it appear that it was only
applied for."</p>

<p>"Surely it is not wise that thou shouldst be known
to have granted favour unto a traitor?" was the monk's
clever reply.</p>

<p>Still Nicholas hesitated, at which Rasputin grew
furious, declaring that he had no time to waste in idle
discussion.</p>

<p>Dropping the familiar form of speech he was in
the habit of using to the Emperor, he stood erect and
said:</p>

<p>"You know the message which your dead father gave
you at the s&eacute;ance last night! If you refuse to sign this
decree, then I will abandon Russia to-day and leave you,
the Empress and the lad to your fate. Remember, I
am God's messenger and your divine guide!"</p>

<p>The Tsar stood terror-stricken and in fear lest the
real ruler of Russia should once again depart from
Petrograd and refuse to return. Further refusal to sign
was useless; therefore he bit his lip in chagrin and
appended his signature to the document, which not only
deprived the unfortunate Yakowleff of his concession,
but also denounced him as a traitor and a swindler.</p>

<p>The result was that not only did Rasputin obtain
possession of the concession for Otchakov, but he sold
it a month later for a huge sum to a syndicate of
bankers in Vienna, who still hold it. The monk, after
paying a dole to the ex-agent of police, divided up the
spoils with Protopopoff, St&uuml;rmer and Soukhomlinoff, and,
in addition, he bought a very valuable diamond necklace
for Anna Vyrubova.</p>

<p>As for poor Yakowleff, he was, as Rasputin had
plotted, prosecuted in London for fraud, and sentenced
at the Old Bailey to a term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>As the months went on, in the first half of 1914, I
noticed that the acquaintanceship between Rasputin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
his well-paid chemist-friend, Badmayev, became closer.
Badmayev held the formula of the poisonous concoction
which at intervals Anna Vyrubova secretly introduced
into the food of the Tsarevitch, causing the poor lad
those mysterious illnesses which were puzzling the
physicians of Europe.</p>

<p>That some fresh plot of a diabolical nature was in
progress I felt confident, but of its actual motive I
could ascertain nothing. Yet it turned out to be a
conspiracy&mdash;no doubt inspired and suggested by Potsdam&mdash;of
a peculiarly devilish character.</p>

<p>It was on that fateful day that the "Germanisation"
of Russia became complete. Thanks to the traitorous
assurances of Soukhomlinoff, Minister of War, Russia,
alas! found herself suddenly plunged into hostilities.
Petrograd, of course, went wild with excitement. Our
loyal Russians, who believed in official declarations and
in their Tsar, were ready to fly at the Teutons, little
dreaming that already, before a single shot was fired,
Germany held all the honours of the game, and had
the Russian bear shackled hand and foot.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon Rasputin called me,
and handing me an envelope which seemed to contain
some small object&mdash;a lady's silver powder-puff case I
afterwards knew it to be&mdash;said:</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor, I want you to go to the booking-office of
the Finnish station at the departure of the train for
Helsingfors at five-thirty. There you will meet a fair-haired
young man who knows you by sight. He will
say the word 'Anak,' and when he does, hand him this
in secret. He will quite understand."</p>

<p>This order I carried out. I had not been at the
crowded station five minutes when a young man, carrying
a small handbag, elbowed his way through the excited
crowd and uttered in an undertone the word "Anak."
I greeted him, and surreptitiously handed him the little
packet, for which he thanked me and disappeared on
to the platform.</p>

<p>My curiosity being aroused I waited until after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
departure of the train, when I watched the mysterious
young man return from the platform, hurry out of the
station, and jump into a droshky and drive off.</p>

<p>When I returned and reported my meeting with the
young man, Rasputin seemed much gratified, and even
telephoned to St&uuml;rmer, who was at that moment at
the palace, having been called to the War Council which
the Emperor&mdash;who had again consulted his dead father's
spirit at a further s&eacute;ance on the previous night&mdash;was
now holding.</p>

<p>It appeared that a dinner had a week before been
arranged by Prince Galitzine, to which the Grand Dukes
Nicholas Nicholaievitch, Constantin Constantinovitch, and
Michael Alexandrovitch, together with Generals Arapoff,
Daniloff, Brusiloff, and Rennenkampf, had been invited.
At first it was proposed to cancel the engagement owing
to the critical position of affairs, but on the suggestion of
the Grand Duke Nicholas it was not abandoned, for, as
he pointed out, it would bring together the loyal leaders
of the army on the eve of great events, and that, after
dinner, views might be exchanged in confidence for the
national benefit.</p>

<p>Now earlier that same day Rasputin had given me
a note to deliver to the Grand Duke Michael, whom I
had failed to find, but was told that he was to dine at
Prince Galitzine's. So about half-past six o'clock I took
it to the prince's house, when, to my surprise, as I
passed into the great hall I saw the same fair-haired
young man to whom I had delivered that envelope in
secret an hour before. He was one of the prince's
servants, but he had not seen me!</p>

<p>A sudden suspicion seized me. I asked to see the
prince, and when shown up to his room I delivered the
note for the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>Then, having seen that the door was closed, I asked
permission to say something in strictest confidence, and
told him of the mysterious envelope I had delivered to
his servant.</p>

<p>He heard me through, gave me his hand in promise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
that he would not betray my confidence, thanked me,
and dismissed me.</p>

<p>Next day the prince called me to him in secret, and
told me that in the possession of the young man was
found a lady's silver powder-puff box filled with what
looked and smelt like toilet-powder. This, on being
examined, was discovered to be a most subtle and
dangerous poison&mdash;one evidently prepared by that
diabolical poisoner, Badmayev.</p>

<p>The young man had been forced by his master to
swallow some, and had died in great agony. Thus it
was proved that Rasputin and the camarilla had, on
the very night of the outbreak of war, plotted to sweep
off at one blow our most famous Russian generals, and
leave our country practically without any military leaders
of experience and at the mercy of the Huns!</p>

<p>The vile plot would no doubt have succeeded, and
the deaths put down to ptomaine poisoning, as so many
have been, had I not so fortunately recognised the young
valet as he crossed the hall of Prince Galitzine's house.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that Rasputin and his friends
hesitated at nothing in their frantic endeavours to
gain their own sordid ends and to secure victory for
Germany.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">the tragedy of madame svetchine</span></h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Sister!</span> thou who hast chosen to become the bride
of Heaven, listen unto me, and repeat these words after
me!" exclaimed the monk Rasputin, holding over the
kneeling countess the big bejewelled cross which the
Empress had given him, and in which were set some of
the finest jewels of the Romanoffs.</p>

<p>"I will, O Father," replied Paula Yakimovitch, a
pretty young woman, whose husband was Governor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
Yakutsk, far off in Siberia, and who had begged him
to leave her in Petrograd.</p>

<p>"Then repeat these words," said the bearded saint,
fixing his weird, hypnotic eyes upon her. "Thou art
my holy Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou art my holy Father&mdash;&mdash;" exclaimed the
Governor's wife in obedience.</p>

<p>"To thee I bow, and to thee I acknowledge that thou
art sent by Almighty God to save our holy Russia."</p>

<p>She repeated the words amid the silence of that
afternoon assembly of the sister-disciples at the Starets'
house, a gathering which included Madame Vyrubova
and her sister, Madame Soukhomlinoff; Madame Katacheff,
wife of the Governor-General of Finland; pretty
little Madame Makotine, to whose salon everyone
scrambled; and old Countess Chapadier, bedecked, as
always, with diamonds.</p>

<p>"I hereby swear in my belief that God has sent to
our Russia his divine saviour in the human form of
Gregory Rasputin, and that the sin I commit in my
belief is the sin which is easiest forgiven, and that by
prayer and fasting my sins will be remitted, even as I
am admitted to the sect of the righteous and holy."</p>

<p>These blasphemous words the young woman repeated
after the unwashed saint, who, standing upon a sort of
dais in the big upstairs salon, still held up the jewelled
cross suspended from his neck in front of him.</p>

<p>"Salvation is in contriteness," the monk went on, for
that was what the sly scoundrel had invented. "Contriteness
can only come after we have sinned. Let us
therefore sin, my sisters, in order to gain salvation! By
sinning with me," he added, having reached the apogee
of his influence, "salvation is all the more certain to
come to you for this reason&mdash;that I am filled with the
Holy Spirit!"</p>

<p>"God be thanked! God be thanked!" fell from the
lips of those thirty or so bamboozled and hysterical
women, who, seated on forms as school-children might
sit, had assembled to assist at the admission of Countess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
Yakimovitch to the secret and disgraceful cult of the
blasphemous charlatan.</p>

<p>The date was September the 7th, 1914.</p>

<p>Russia had been at war with Germany for a month,
and the Press of the Allies was full of cheerful optimism
regarding what one of your London journalists had called
"the Russian steam-roller." We in holy Russia believed
in "the mills of God," and the nation as a whole was
confident that it could resist the Teuton invasion.</p>

<p>The neophyte, beneath the extraordinary hypnotism
of the "saint," felt the dirty fingers upon her brow,
as, in a strange jargon of religious phrases and open
blasphemy, he pronounced a kind of benediction upon
her, adjuring her carefully to preserve the secrets of the
sect "from your own mother and father, sister, brother,
husband and child." Then he added: "In me, Gregory
Rasputin, you see the One sent by Heaven as the Healer
and Deliverer of Russia from the hands of the oppressor.
To me the Emperor, but an earthly king, hath delegated
his imperial powers. I am the saviour of Russia. Believe
in me and in my teachings and ye shall have life, health
and prosperity&mdash;with the life beyond the grave. Disobey,
and thou shalt be eternally damned, together with all
thy family. I, Gregory Rasputin, who hath been sent
to thee as saviour," he added, "take unto me as sister
Paula Vladimirovna to be my <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disicple'">disciple</ins>!"</p>

<p>"May God forbid!" cried a woman's voice from
among those assembled. "Let us end this blasphemy!"</p>

<p>The effect was almost electrical. Rasputin started,
and gazed at the rows of elegantly-dressed women, his
disciples, and the few good-looking young women whom
he had invited to be present.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on a young and pretty woman seated
at the back of the little audience. "I repeat those
words!"</p>

<p>Startled myself at the boldness of the young lady,
I saw that she was dark, extremely good-looking, and
refined. Rasputin had met her a week before at the
salon of old Countess Lazareff, and she having expressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
a desire to know more of the secret cult of which so
many curious rumours were rife in Petrograd society, he
had allowed Madame Trevetski, the wife of the ex-Commander-in-Chief
in the Caucasus, to bring her that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Now, it must be said that no lady was admitted to
those weekly reunions of the sister-disciples unless she
first had the full approval of the Starets. She must be
good-looking and possessed of either wealth or influence,
but in preference wealth. And it was certain that no
woman was ever invited unless it was Rasputin's intention
to admit her to the secrets of his "religion."</p>

<p>Yet here was open defiance! This lady, whose name
was Madame Anastasia Svetchine, was the wife of
Colonel Svetchine, who was on the Staff of the Etat-Major
at Vilna, and who was already at the battle front.
Before Rasputin had allowed her to be brought to his
house it had fallen to my lot to make some inquiries
concerning her, and I had found that she was of good
family, that her husband was possessed of fair means,
and that besides their house in Vilna they had a comfortable
residence in the Kirotshnaya, in Petrograd. She
moved in that rather gay, go-ahead set of which, prior
to the war, the reckless Madame Soukhomlinoff was the
centre, and she had recently become quite a notable
figure in Petrograd society.</p>

<p>Rasputin, furious at her interruption, roared:</p>

<p>"Silence, woman! Go out of the room at once!"</p>

<p>But Madame Svetchine, springing to her feet, cried:
"It is monstrous! Disgraceful! Blasphemous! It is
true what Purichkevitch has said in the Duma&mdash;that
you are the evil force in Russia! Though a woman,
I will have none of your mock piety and disgraceful
licentiousness!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I see, madame, that you are an enemy&mdash;eh?"
he said in a slow, deliberate way. "And let me
tell you, when Gregory Rasputin has an enemy, he does
not rest until that enemy is swept from his path. If
you defy me, you defy your God!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
"I defy you!" cried the woman shrilly, making a
dramatic scene. "But I fear my God, and Him alone."</p>

<p>"Oh! be silent, I beg!" cried Countess Lazareff in
French, wringing her hands, she having introduced her,
while all were horrified that the holy Father should be
thus openly denounced before his "sisters."</p>

<p>"What is that woman saying?" the monk shouted
across to me, for he did not know French, and was
suspicious that the words contained yet another insult
until I translated them to him.</p>

<p>"I refuse to be silent!" declared the colonel's young
wife. "I will describe to all whom I meet what has
taken place here to-day&mdash;the mockery of it all. It is
shameful how any woman in her senses, refined and
educated, should fall beneath the fascination of such
a brute!"</p>

<p>This was greeted with wild exclamations of surprise
and indignation. Indeed, so furious became the "sisters"
at such open insult that I was, at Rasputin's orders,
compelled to conduct her out.</p>

<p>In the hall the young lady, who was certainly very
pretty, became quite quiet again, and turning to me said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Rajevski, I came here on purpose to
denounce that infernal charlatan who is your employer.
I am not without friends&mdash;and influential ones. I have
spoken my mind fearlessly and openly. No doubt I
have made an enemy of Grichka, but for that I care
nothing, so long as I have exposed him."</p>

<p>Little did the unfortunate young lady know of Rasputin's
low cunning and diabolical unscrupulousness when
she had uttered those words. I made no reply, for I
feared that she would live to regret having created that
scene in the monk's holy-of-holies.</p>

<p>Late that evening, having been out, I returned to find
the "saint" seated with the Minister Maklakoff, the man
whom the newspaper <i>Utro Rossy</i> described as "The
love-sick Panther." Both were in an advanced state
of intoxication, and when I entered, Rasputin, in a thick
voice, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
"Ah! my dear F&eacute;odor, I have just been describing
the scene to-day with that woman Anastasia Svetchine&mdash;the
little spitfire! But a pretty woman, F&eacute;odor&mdash;very
pretty woman, eh? It's a pity"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"a great
pity!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the long-moustached Minister, who
had just come from an official reception, and was in
his hussar uniform, with gold braid and many decorations.
"Are you not better rid of her, my friend?
Women of her sort are usually dangerous."</p>

<p>"I know she is dangerous," growled the holy Father,
taking a deep gulp of champagne. "That is why I
intend that she shall pay dearly for her defiance."</p>

<p>"Is she worth troubling about?" I queried. "You
have so many affairs to attend to just now."</p>

<p>"Gregory Rasputin always attends to his enemies first,
F&eacute;odor," he replied huskily.</p>

<p>The eyes of "The love-sick Panther" twinkled through
his rimless pince-nez. Well he knew the bitter revenge
which the Starets wreaked upon any who dared to
challenge his divinity.</p>

<p>Maklakoff was at the time the Tsar's favourite
Minister, and it was quite usual after a Cabinet Council
for the Emperor to ask him and Soukhomlinoff to remain
behind, as both were voted "really jolly fellows." Then
Their Majesties would unite with the children and a few
intimates, including the Father and Anna of course, and
they would have a little fun. Maklakoff was famed for
his power of mimicry. He could imitate the barking
of dogs, and frequently announced his presence to the
Imperial family by barking in the corridors of Tsarskoe-Selo,
while his most famous imitation was that of a
panther. And this of a Cabinet Minister in days of
war!</p>

<p>"O Nicholas Alexievitch, <i>do</i> let us see you as a
panther!" the Emperor would often say.</p>

<p>Then the Minister of State would coil himself up
beneath a sofa and roar like a panther. Then, crawling
slowly out on all fours, he would suddenly take a leap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>
and land in an arm-chair or upon a sofa, greatly to the
delight of the Imperial family, while the Grand Duchesses
and the Tsarevitch would go wild with glee.</p>

<p>When, by the way, Maklakoff was dismissed in 1915,
as a result of the anti-German riots in Moscow, the paper
<i>Utro Rossy</i> was fined three thousand roubles for publishing
an article headed "The Leap of the Love-sick
Panther."</p>

<p>Maklakoff was a bosom friend of Rasputin, a dissolute
evil-liver after the monk's own heart, and more
than once had, in my presence, mentioned the names of
certain good-looking women in various classes of society
who might be invited to become disciples of the sadic
Anti-Christ.</p>

<p>Within a week of the scene created by Madame
Svetchine, Rasputin had already commenced to seek his
revenge in a deep and cunning way. He had heard
from several persons that Madame Anastasia was going
about Petrograd openly denouncing him, and that she
had been in communication with Monsieur Miliukoff of
the Cadets, and also Count Bobrinski. For the time
being Rasputin was devoting his days to the reorganisation
of his "disciples." His traitorous interference in
politics had already borne fruit in favour of Germany.</p>

<p>The events that were happening at that very moment
mercilessly showed up the faults of our Russian administration,
which was Germanic by origin in its
traditions and its sentiments. Indeed, at that moment,
when the enemy at the gates was knocking over the
fortresses of Poland like ant-hills, intrigues for place
and honour were rife everywhere, and Maklakoff was
playing the "panther" to amuse the ladies of Tsarskoe-Selo!</p>

<p>Rasputin one day called to him one of his half-dozen
sycophants of the secret police, whom the Minister
Protopopoff had placed at his disposal for purposes of
personal protection, but in reality to act as his spies and
<i>agents-provocateurs</i>.</p>

<p>To this fellow, Depp by name, he had given in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>structions
that the <i>dossiers</i> of both Colonel Svetchine
and his wife should be brought to him. Next day they
arrived, and for half an hour Depp sat reading over
to him the various police reports from Vilna and those
of Petrograd.</p>

<p>The monk, leaning back in his arm-chair, stroked
his unkempt beard, his eyes fixed out of the window,
brooding over his devilish scheme.</p>

<p>An hour later, after he had dispatched Depp to make
certain inquiries in Petrograd concerning the doings of
the colonel's young wife, he said to me:</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor, I must see Soukhomlinoff to-night. Telephone
to him at the Ministry. If he is not there, you
will find him at the palace. If so, tell him to call here
at once when he returns to Petrograd."</p>

<p>I found the Minister of War was at Tsarskoe-Selo,
and spoke to him there, giving him Rasputin's message,
and receiving a reply that he would be with us at ten
o'clock that night.</p>

<p>I had to keep an appointment, at Rasputin's orders,
with Protopopoff&mdash;to deliver a letter and receive a reply;
therefore I was not present when His Excellency the
General arrived. What the pair arranged I had no
idea, for when I returned to the Gorokhovaya the general
was just stepping into his big car with its brilliant
headlights.</p>

<p>"Good night, F&eacute;odor!" he shouted to me merrily,
for he was of a genial nature, and next moment the
powerful car drove away.</p>

<p>Events marched rapidly during the next fortnight.
I had gone with Rasputin to the General Headquarters
of the Army at the Polish front, a journey which the
intriguer had been sent upon by those at Court whose
mouthpiece he was&mdash;to discuss a peace necessary for the
Empire, he declared.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I knew that three days before the
secret messenger Hardt had arrived from Berlin by way
of Sweden, bearing a dispatch with elaborate instructions
to the Starets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
The Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch received us
on the evening of our arrival at Headquarters, and, of
course, the monk was full of one of those fantastic tales
which succeeded so well with many, either the ignorant
or credulous, or those to whose personal advantage it
was to pretend to believe him.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke received the Starets politely but
stiffly, for he well knew the power he wielded in the
Empire, and that his will was law.</p>

<p>"Ah, Highness!" exclaimed the monk, "war is indeed
a calamity. Alas! that Russia hath offended God
by entering upon it. But thou, in thy wisdom, must
put an end to it. The Holy Virgin appeared to me in
a dream, and told me we must conclude peace. I come
to inform thee of her will."</p>

<p>"When didst thou see the Virgin?" asked the
Grand Duke.</p>

<p>"Three days ago."</p>

<p>"Now that's odd," he replied. "I, too, saw her,
but it was only two days ago, and she said to me:
'Gregory is coming to see thee. He will advise peace.
Don't listen to him, but expel him like the scoundrel
he is. If he goes on troubling and intriguing have him
thrashed.'"</p>

<p>The monk went livid.</p>

<p>"And further," continued Nicholas Nicholaievitch, "if
you remain here, you infernal charlatan and blackmailer,
that is what I shall do. So you can return to Alexandra
Feodorovna and tell her what I say. My soldiers are
fighting for Russia, and they will continue to do so,
however many visions you may have&mdash;and however
much German gold you may grab with your filthy paws.
Get out!"</p>

<p>Rasputin stood speechless for a moment. Then, with
an imprecation upon his lips, he turned and retired.</p>

<p>Three days later we were back in Petrograd, but
the monk, who never forgot, at once set about plotting
the Grand Duke's retirement.</p>

<p>One morning, among the monk's correspondence, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
found a letter for Rasputin, which had been brought by
hand from the Ministry of War, marked "Strictly
private." On opening it, I read the following, which
bore as signature the initials of Soukhomlinoff:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In a further reference to the suspicions against Colonel
Svetchine, inquiries made fully confirm your view. The
political police who made domiciliary visits to his house in
Petrograd and his apartments in Vilna found nothing of
importance. In Vilna, however, it has been discovered that,
immediately prior to the war, he had established friendly
relations with Elise Isembourg, who was an agent of Germany
and a friend of Miassoyedeff. At my instructions we
have allowed the Colonel leave, and he returned to Vilna
to meet the woman, who had, at our orders, written to him.
She, acting upon our instructions, offered him a sum of
money to betray certain plans of the defences of Grodno,
agents of secret police being concealed during the interview.
At first he stoutly refused, but next day he met her again
and succumbed to the temptation, so at the present moment
he is preparing the information she seeks."</p></div>

<p>I read this over to the monk, who at once rubbed
his hands together in satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ah! all goes well, my dear F&eacute;odor!" he exclaimed.
"That woman will be sorry she denounced me, I assure
you."</p>

<p>I could discern the motive of the conspiracy, but as
yet had no idea of its true depth.</p>

<p>It was not until a week later, when one night the
Minister of War called upon the monk, and in my presence
they discussed the Svetchine affair.</p>

<p>"You did well, General," declared Rasputin, with an
evil smile. "What has really happened in Vilna?"</p>

<p>"Well, the woman Isembourg, though she was a spy
of Germany, is now on our side in the contra-espionage
service," was his reply. "From the first she assured
me that the colonel was extremely honest and patriotic.
Though before the war she had several times tried to
induce him to give her military information, yet he always
declined and endeavoured to avoid her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
"Well, that difficulty can be overcome, surely?" asked
the monk.</p>

<p>General Soukhomlinoff, a traitor himself, laughed
lightly as he replied:</p>

<p>"Of course. There were other means. Elise, three
days ago, handed over to me a typewritten document
revealing the secrets of the defences of Grodno, which
she reported had been given to her by Colonel Svetchine
in return for a promise of ten thousand roubles when
she could obtain the money from a secret source in
Petrograd."</p>

<p>"Then he is a traitor!" exclaimed the monk eagerly.</p>

<p>The general winked, and replied: "Elise Isembourg
declares that he is, and that he gave her the document."</p>

<p>"He, of course, denies it?"</p>

<p>"He knows nothing as yet," said His Excellency.
"I have issued orders for his arrest to-day, and have
given instructions for the court martial to be held here,
in Petrograd."</p>

<p>The evil monk laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," he remarked. "And probably the
colonel has never yet seen this typewritten document?"</p>

<p>"Probably," replied the Minister of War, with a
mysterious smile. "There have been such cases. I have
fixed the court martial for next Thursday, and I assure
you it will be difficult for the colonel to prove his
innocence!"</p>

<p>From that conversation I gathered the diabolical
nature of Rasputin's plot against a perfectly innocent
man, as revenge for his wife's insults.</p>

<p>Next day we were called to the palace, for the
Empress was sorely worried over the health of the Tsarevitch,
and she implored the holy Father to pray for
him, little dreaming that the ever-recurring attacks were
due to the subtle poison administered in secret by her
most trusted favourite, Madame Vyrubova. For several
days we remained at the palace, while Rasputin performed
one of his "miracles," namely, the restoration
of the lad to his normal condition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
What if the Empress had known that the "miracles"
in which she so fervently believed were merely performed
by the administration of certain antidotes to the poison
already given!</p>

<p>While at the palace on that occasion I witnessed some
strange doings at a spiritualistic s&eacute;ance to which Bossant,
the notorious French medium, had been commanded.
The Emperor, Empress and their intimates were present,
including Rasputin and myself, and when the circle was
formed and the s&eacute;ance in full swing the Tsar consulted
the spirit of his dead father as to how he should act
in the conduct of the war against Germany.</p>

<p>The reply, of course, arranged by the Empress and
her friends, was something as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thou hast done well, my son, and thou art worthy
the throne of the Romanoffs. Continue to defend our
beloved land. Trust in the counsels of those about
thee, of thy wife, of thy Ministers, especially St&uuml;rmer,
Protopopoff and Soukhomlinoff, as well as the advice
which the holy Father is ever giving thee. All have been
sent to thee as good and faithful guides. My blessing is
upon thee, O my son!"</p></div>

<p>Such was the "message" so cleverly given to the
credulous monarch by the traitors and intriguers about
him. And alas! he believed truly and absolutely,
ignorant of the fact that some thousands of roubles
had gone into the medium's pocket as price of his
connivance.</p>

<p>On returning to Petrograd late on Thursday night
I found among the monk's correspondence a letter from
Madame Svetchine, a long, regretful letter, in which she
expressed the greatest sorrow for the words she had
uttered at the assembly of the sister-disciples, and begged
to be forgiven. Further, she announced her intention
of calling upon the Father "upon a serious and urgent
matter."</p>

<p>I told him this, whereat he growled:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
"Ah! the woman is coming to her senses. Yes. If
she comes I will see her. She is pretty, F&eacute;odor&mdash;pretty&mdash;yes,
very pretty."</p>

<p>I drew a long breath. The unfortunate woman knew,
no doubt, the serious charge against her husband, but
never dreamed that Rasputin was the cause of that
false accusation.</p>

<p>Just before I ascended to my room to retire&mdash;the hour
being about one o'clock in the morning&mdash;the telephone
bell rang, and I answered it.</p>

<p>One of the officials at the War Office was, I found,
at the other end.</p>

<p>"His Excellency the Minister has an urgent message
to transmit to the Father," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, stating who I was.</p>

<p>"Then listen, please. The message he has written
reads: <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '&quot;'">'</ins>Colonel Ivan Svetchine has been tried by court
martial, which sat until half an hour ago. He has been
condemned on a charge of dealing with the enemy and
revealing military secrets to Germany, and ordered to be
executed for treason. The execution is fixed to take place
in the Peter and Paul Fortress at dawn on Saturday.'"</p>

<p>I replaced the telephone receiver with a heavy heart.
Yet another innocent man was to die as victim of
Rasputin's overweening vanity and evil influence in every
quarter.</p>

<p>When I entered and told the monk, who was already
in bed in a half-drunken state, he merely turned over
and continued snoring.</p>

<p>On Friday night, when, as usual, we had returned
from Tsarskoe-Selo in one of the Imperial motor-cars,
I was told that a lady was waiting to see the Starets,
but she would give no name. She was persistent that
she must see him, and had already waited nearly three
hours.</p>

<p>When I entered the waiting-room, a small chamber
at the end of a corridor, I found it to be the wife of
the condemned man. She was dressed in dead black, her
beautiful face tear-stained and deathly pale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
"Ah! Monsieur Rajevski!" she cried, rushing towards
me. "You know me&mdash;Madame Svetchine&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," I said. "I remember you."</p>

<p>"You will let me see him&mdash;won't you?" she cried
in great distress, as she gripped my hand nervously.
"He has, I hope, forgiven me; surely he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gave him your letter," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and what did he say?" she gasped in
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Well, the truth is that he said nothing," I replied,
adding: "He was much occupied with other things."</p>

<p>"Ah! I must see him!" cried the frantic woman.
"I was wrong to speak as I did. The Father is the great
power in Russia. I must throw myself upon his mercy."</p>

<p>I promised to take her to him, and left her to inform
Rasputin of the arrival of his expected visitor.</p>

<p>With an evil glint in those terrible eyes of his, he
rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p>"Good, F&eacute;odor!" he said, striding across the room.
"I will see the woman. Oh, yes, if she wishes to see
me I will not deny her that pleasure," he added with
biting sarcasm. Truly, he was weird and horrible in the
hour of his triumph.</p>

<p>A few moments later I ushered the pale, wan woman
in black into his presence.</p>

<p>"Holy Father!" she cried wildly, "forgive me&mdash;say
that you forgive the unconsidered words of a weak and
unworthy woman."</p>

<p>"Forgive&mdash;why?" he asked, standing erect and fingering
his bejewelled cross. "I do not understand why I
am honoured by this visit, madame."</p>

<p>"Ah! Of course you do not know. Pardon, I have
forgotten to explain. My husband&mdash;&mdash;" And she broke
into tears. "My dear husband&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what of your husband?" asked Rasputin.
"He is at the front. Has he been wounded&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not that!" she cried. "They have made
a false charge against him. Some woman named Isembourg,
whom he knew in Vilna before the war, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
made an allegation against him of traitorous dealings
with the enemy. She has given over to the Ministry
of War some documents containing the plans of the
defences of Grodno, which she declares he has sold to
her! But it is lies&mdash;all lies. I know it!"</p>

<p>"Really, this is quite a romantic story, madame,"
said Rasputin, quite unmoved. "Why should this woman
make such charges?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? Ah! but you do not know the
worst!" she went on. "The court martial actually
accepted this woman's statements&mdash;statements that were
lies&mdash;all of them! My husband is devoted to me, and
I love him&mdash;ah, so dearly! He is all in all to me.
And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the woman&mdash;Isembourg, I believe you say&mdash;she
is a friend of his, eh?" interrupted the monk, his hands
crossed over his breast in that pious attitude he always
assumed when listening.</p>

<p>"She says she was his friend before the war&mdash;before
we married, indeed. Perhaps she was," answered the
condemned man's wife. "But she is undoubtedly an
<i>agent-provocateuse</i> of police set to tempt men to their
downfall."</p>

<p>"Of that I have no knowledge," was Rasputin's cold
reply.</p>

<p>"But you will help me, holy Father! Do&mdash;for the
sake of a man who is innocent&mdash;for the sake&mdash;the sake
of his unborn child! Ah! you will show mercy, won't
you?" she begged.</p>

<p>"I do not follow you," was the monk's reply, in
pretence of ignorance.</p>

<p>In a frenzy of despair the wretched wife flung herself
upon her knees before the scoundrel, and cried:</p>

<p>"My husband! There is yet time to save him! He&mdash;he
is to be shot&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;as soon as it is light!
You&mdash;and you alone&mdash;can induce the Emperor to order
a revision of the sentence or a new trial. You will&mdash;you
are all-powerful and divine!"</p>

<p>"Pardon, madame, that is not your true estimate of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
Gregory Rasputin," he said, with biting sarcasm. "Only
a short time ago I was a charlatan and a fraud! No;
your opinion cannot have altered in so short a time."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;if you are sent by God to Russia&mdash;will
never allow an innocent man to be murdered in this
fashion&mdash;condemned upon the word of a notorious
woman."</p>

<p>"The affair does not concern me, I assure you," he
laughed. "If your husband has been condemned to death
he must have had a fair and impartial trial by his brother
officers. I am not a military man, and know nothing
of such matters. If he has been found to be a traitor,"
added the unholy spy of Germany, "then the sentence
is just."</p>

<p>"But he is no traitor. He is as patriotic as you
are yourself, Father! He has ever been so," cried the
despairing woman.</p>

<p>"I have no means of knowing that," he replied in a
hard voice, gazing at her with those strange, wide-open
eyes, and endeavouring to put that spell upon her
that few women could resist. "Nevertheless, I will
forgive you, and, further, I will exercise my influence
to save your husband's life if you will consent to enter
the circle of our holy disciples."</p>

<p>The desperate young woman held her breath for a
few seconds, staring at him wildly as upon her knees
she still knelt, clutching the "saint's" dirty hands.</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "That I will never do."</p>

<p>Rasputin saw that his plot had failed. Here at least
was one woman over whom he was powerless, one who
regarded him as a fraud. In an instant he flew into a
sudden rage.</p>

<p>"Enough!" he cried, throwing her off. "You refuse
to accept my condition&mdash;therefore your husband shall
die!"</p>

<p>The wretched woman, her countenance pale as death,
tried to speak. Her lips moved, but no sound came
from them. Next moment, by dint of supreme effort, she
struggled to her feet and rose stiffly. Then, a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>
later, her hands clenched and despair in her splendid
eyes, she turned and staggered out.</p>

<p>Four hours later Colonel Svetchine boldly faced a
firing-party in the yard of the fortress. There was a
word of command, and next second the gallant soldier
fell forward on his face&mdash;dead.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">traitorous work</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> true story of the tragic death of a Russian civil
servant named Ivan Naglovski, and of the mysterious
explosion which destroyed the great munition works at
Okhta and killed over four hundred and fifty persons
and injured seven hundred, has never been told.</p>

<p>There have been sinister whisperings in Russia, but
I am here able to unfold the amazing truth for the
first time.</p>

<p>I had accompanied Rasputin to the Verkhotursky
Monastery at Perm; the house in the Gorokhovaya was
closed, its wooden shutters were fastened, and the
Empress was desolate without her "holy Father." St&uuml;rmer,
the Prime Minister, was with the Emperor, daily plotting
and striving for the betrayal of our nation to the Germans,
and "Satan in a silk hat"&mdash;as one of the Grand Dukes
had nicknamed the Minister of the Interior, Protopopoff&mdash;had
gone on a mission to London, ostensibly in Russian
interests, but really as a spy of Germany. The latter
was, of course, not known at the time, for the British
Government sent him on a tour of munition and other
centres, showed him what they were preparing, and
f&ecirc;ted him in London as the representative of their ally.
We now know that, on his return to Petrograd, he at
once became violently anti-British, and made a full report
of all he knew to the Wilhelmstrasse!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
The purpose of the monk's pilgrimage to Perm was
to form a branch of his believers in that city. He had
left Petrograd dressed as a pilgrim, with hair-shirt and
staff complete, and as such he posed to everybody. The
world, however, did not know that the rooms allotted
to him in the monastery by the rascally bishop, whom
he had himself appointed, were the acme of luxury, and
that in them he held drunken orgies every night.</p>

<p>After we had been there three weeks an Imperial
courier brought him a letter from Peterhof. It was night,
and the monk was in an advanced state of intoxication
with his companions, three other mock-pious rascals like
himself.</p>

<p>When I handed him the letter he glanced at the
Imperial cipher on the envelope, and, grinning, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is from the Empress. Read out what the woman
says."</p>

<p>I hesitated, suggesting that it would be better if
I read it to him in private.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he laughed. "There is nothing private in it.
Read it, F&eacute;odor."</p>

<p>So, thus ordered, I obeyed. The letter was written
in Russian, but with mistakes in grammar and orthography,
for the Empress had never learned to write
Russian correctly. These are the words I read for the
delectation of the dissolute quartette:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Holy Father</span>,&mdash;Why have you not written? Why this
long dead silence when my poor heart is hourly yearning
for news of you and for your words of comfort?</p>

<p>"I am, alas! weak, but I love you, for you are all in
all to me. Oh! if I could but hold your dear hand and lay
my head upon your shoulder! Ah! can I ever forget that
feeling of perfect peace and blank forgetfulness that I
experience when you are near me.</p>

<p>"Now that you have gone, life is only one grey sea of
despair. There was a Court last night, but I did not attend.
Instead Anna [Madame <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Vyruboya'">Vyrubova</ins>] and I read your sweet
letters together, and we kissed your picture.</p>

<p>"As I have so often told you, dear Father, I want to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
a good daughter of Christ. But oh! it is so difficult. Help
me, dear Father. Pray for me. Pray always for Alexis
[the Tsarevitch]. Come back to us at once. Nikki [the
Tsar] says we cannot endure life without you, for there are
so many pitfalls before us. For myself, I am longing for
your return&mdash;longing&mdash;always longing! Without our weekly
meetings all is gloom&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>Here I broke off. What followed ought, I saw, not
to be read aloud to that trio, who might at any moment
turn to be enemies of the Starets.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, smiling in gratification. "The woman
evidently misses me. It places a woman in her proper
position to discard her for a while," he added with a
drunken laugh. "What else does she say?"</p>

<p>"Only that they are due to go to Yalta, but that Her
Majesty awaits your return," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then let her wait. I am very comfortable here.
Perm is pleasant as a change."</p>

<p>I knew well that he was enjoying himself hugely
and had already formed a great circle of hysterical women
who believed in his divinity and practised the rites of his
disgraceful "religion."</p>

<p>The final words of that amazing letter, which in itself
showed the terms upon which Alexandra Feodorovna
was with the convicted horse-stealer from Pokrovsky,
were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here, O dear Father, we have only the everlasting toll
of war! Germany is winning&mdash;as she will surely win. She
must. You will see to that! But we must all of us maintain
a brave face towards our Russian public. In you alone
I have faith. May God bring you back to us very soon.
Alexis is asking for you daily. We are due to go to Yalta,
but shall not move before we meet here. I embrace you, and
so do Nikki and Anna.&mdash;Your devoted daughter, <span class="smcap">Alix</span>."</p></div>

<p>The unkempt quartette, treating the Empress's expressions
of affection as a huge joke, filled their glasses
with champagne and drank heavily again, while Rasputin
began to regale his "saintly" companions with stories
of the intimate life of the pro-German Empress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
Truly, it was a gay, dissolute life that the verminous
rascal was leading at the Verkhotursky Monastery, and
many were the women over whom he exercised his weird,
uncanny fascination.</p>

<p>"Believe in me and you will receive God's blessing,"
was his constant blasphemous declaration to every woman
whose looks were even passable. "Doubt me and you
will be damned."</p>

<p>By Russia's millions in the provinces he was looked
upon as the holy man sent by God to the Tsar. Did
not the "saint" eat at the Emperor's table, and did he
not prompt His Majesty in fighting the Germans? None
ever dreamed that the unkempt miracle-worker, whose
fascination for women was so astounding, was the secret
ambassador of the Assassin of Potsdam.</p>

<p>Two of those companions of his nightly drinking
bouts at Perm were named Rouchine and Yepantchine,
brawny fellows whose evil life was almost as notorious
as Rasputin's. Rouchine had been a conjurer before he
adopted a "holy" life, and by reason of his knowledge of
magic and illusions he frequently assisted the Starets in
performing those "miracles" that so astounded the
mujiks who witnessed them with open mouths.</p>

<p>Whenever things grew a little dull, or Rasputin believed
that his divinity was being doubted, he would
calmly announce:</p>

<p>"I have had a vision. Last night the Holy Virgin
appeared unto me and declared that I must again perform
a miracle so that the world should be made aware
that God, through me, is protecting our dear nation
Russia."</p>

<p>Instantly the news would spread from mouth to mouth&mdash;Rasputin's
name being forbidden to be mentioned in
the newspapers&mdash;that the Starets was about to perform a
miracle, and thousands would assemble in some open
place, where one of Rouchine's conjuring tricks would
be performed.</p>

<p>By this time so deeply had Rasputin corrupted the
Russian Church in its centres of power and administra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>tion
that half the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries were
of his creation, his fellow-thief in Pokrovsky having been
appointed to a bishopric.</p>

<p>Very naturally, Rasputin had made many enemies.
His overbearing vanity, his relentlessness in dealing with
any who stood in his path, and the exposure of his use
of <i>agents-provocateurs</i> in securing the conviction and
imprisonment of anyone who displeased him, had aroused
against him a fierce hatred in certain quarters both in
Petrograd and Moscow. Many of those who had sworn
to be avenged were wronged husbands and fathers, a
number of whom it had been my duty to endeavour to
pacify even at personal risk to myself as the rascal's
secretary.</p>

<p>It was while at Perm that Rasputin received news
that a man named Ivan Naglovski had been in Pokrovsky
busily inquiring into his past, and interviewing his sister-disciples
who were living there. Further, it was reported
that he had been in communication with the monk
Helidor, a man named Golenkovski, whose young wife
was a "disciple" in Petrograd, and with Marie Novitski,
who was preaching loudly against the erotic doctrine
of the new "religion."</p>

<p>It was plain that Ivan Naglovski was a secret enemy.</p>

<p>Acting upon the monk's instructions I returned to
Petrograd, and at the headquarters of the Secret Police
made application that Naglovski's movements should be
watched. Three days later I was assured that a small
league of patriotic men and women had been formed,
with Naglovski at their head, determined to unveil and
unmask the traitorous rascal who was my employer.</p>

<p>I was compelled to return to Perm and inform Rasputin
of the result of my investigations. Before doing
so I went, at Rasputin's instructions by telegraph, to
Peterhof and was admitted by Madame Vyrubova to the
Empress's presence.</p>

<p>The handsome woman was resting in a gorgeous
neglig&eacute;e gown prior to dressing for dinner, but she was
quickly eager and interested when I explained that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
had come from the monk and was returning to Perm at
midnight.</p>

<p>"When will the Holy Father's pilgrimage end?" she
inquired with a sigh. "He has been away weeks, and
never replies to my letters."</p>

<p>"His time is no doubt fully occupied with constant
devotion," remarked Anna Vyrubova in excuse.</p>

<p>"The Father is much occupied, Your Majesty," I
said.</p>

<p>"Tell him for me that I am daily longing for his
return," she said. "But wait. I will write to him and
you shall convey the letter," at which order I bowed.</p>

<p>"The Father is much troubled and perturbed," I remarked.</p>

<p>"About what?" asked Her Majesty.</p>

<p>"He has enemies. Some men and women have
leagued themselves with the object of doing him harm."</p>

<p>"Harm!" she echoed. "What harm can come to
him when, being sent to us by God, he is immune from
any harm that can befall us who are merely human? I
do not understand."</p>

<p>Her words were in themselves sufficient to reveal
how completely and implicitly the Empress of Russia believed
in the pretended divinity of the blasphemous ex-convict.</p>

<p>"All I know, Your Majesty, is that the holy Father
is unduly perturbed."</p>

<p>"Ah! surely he can have no apprehension?" she said.
"Tell him from me that as Christ had enemies so, of
course, he has. But his enemies cannot do him injury."
Then rising and going across to a beautiful buhl escritoire,
she added: "I will write to him. I sent him another
letter by messenger only yesterday&mdash;eight letters, and not
a line of response!"</p>

<p>For ten minutes or so, while the Empress sat writing,
I chatted with Madame Vyrubova, and gave to her news
of the monk.</p>

<p>"Tell him to return as quickly as possible," the
woman said in a low, confidential voice. "If there really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
is a plot on foot against him he is safer in Petrograd
than in Perm. Besides, being on the spot, he will be able
to combat his enemies with a swift and relentless hand."</p>

<p>As Her Majesty was writing the telephone rang.
Next moment it was plain that she was speaking with
the Emperor, who was away at the headquarters of the
army in Poland.</p>

<p>Having listened to something he told her, she said:</p>

<p>"The holy Father's secretary is here with me. The
Father still remains at Perm. I am writing him urgently
asking him to return to us. I wish you also to send a
messenger to him to induce him to come back to Petrograd.
You will be back here next Friday, and is it not
wise to hold another s&eacute;ance next day, eh?"</p>

<p>Then she listened eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed. "I am glad you agree with
me, Nikki. Yes, let us try and get the Father back by
Saturday at latest. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And having rung off, she calmly finished the letter and
secured it with the well-known big seal of black wax.</p>

<p>"Remember," she said as she gave it to me, "the
Father must be here next Saturday for the s&eacute;ance, which
the Emperor will attend. He wishes again to consult the
spirit of his father Alexander. Urge the Father to return
at once."</p>

<p>I promised to do her bidding, and, retiring, at once
left the palace, and at midnight was on my way back to
the far-off town on the Kama.</p>

<p>On the evening of the following day I drove up to the
monastery and there found Rasputin at dinner with the
ex-conjurer Rouchine. When I entered the cosy little
room in which the pair were seated, Rasputin had removed
his long robe and was seated in his shirt-sleeves like the
peasant he was. I handed him the letter from the German-born
Empress, whereupon he said:</p>

<p>"Oh! read it to me, F&eacute;odor. The woman's handwriting
is always a puzzle to me."</p>

<p>I knew how illiterate he was and the reason of his
excuse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
I tore open the envelope and quickly scanned the
scribbled lines.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "not now, Gregory; later."</p>

<p>"But I insist!" cried the Starets fiercely.</p>

<p>"And I refuse!" was my determined reply. "I have
reasons."</p>

<p>Those last three words were not lost upon him, for
Grichka was nothing if not the very acme of shrewdness.
Not an adventurer or <i>escroc</i> in Europe could compare
with him in elusiveness.</p>

<p>"Well, F&eacute;odor, if you have reasons, then I know that
they are sound ones," he said. Then, turning to the
"holy" conjurer, he grinned and said: "F&eacute;odor is a most
excellent secretary. So discreet&mdash;too discreet, I often
think."</p>

<p>"One cannot be too discreet in the present international
crisis," I remarked. "Enemy eyes and ears
are open everywhere. One can never be too careful.
Russia is full of the spies of Germany."</p>

<p>"Quite true, F&eacute;odor&mdash;quite true!" exclaimed Rasputin,
smiling within himself. "Don't you agree, friend
Rouchine?"</p>

<p>"Entirely," replied his accomplice, who, though he
was well paid to assist in working "miracles" before
the peasants, never dreamed that the Starets, who handed
him money with such lavish hand, was the chief agent of
Germany in Russia.</p>

<p>Indeed, Rouchine's only son had been killed in the
advance on Warsaw, hence he held the Hun in abhorrence,
and I am certain that had he known Rasputin
was the Kaiser's personal agent matters would have gone
very differently, and in all probability the enemy plots so
cleverly connived at by Alexandra Feodorovna would have
been exposed in those early days of the war.</p>

<p>The Russian nation even to-day still reveres its Tsar.
They know that he was weak but meant well, and he
was Russian at heart and intent upon stemming the
Teutonic tide which flowed across his border. But for
"the German," Alexandra Feodorovna, not one in all our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
Russian millions has a word except an execration or a
curse, and as accursed by Russia, as is all her breed, she
will go down in history for the detestation of generations
of those who will live between the Baltic and the
Pacific.</p>

<p>Rasputin grew indignant because I crushed the
woman's letter into my pocket without reading it aloud,
but I knew well how to treat him, therefore I began to
explain all that I had learnt from the Secret Police concerning
the activities of Ivan Naglovski.</p>

<p>Both men listened with rapt attention.</p>

<p>"Then the fellow really intends evil?" asked the
monk, as he laid down a chicken-bone, for he always
ate with his fingers.</p>

<p>"I fear he does," was my reply. "But Her Majesty
wonders why you should trouble. She says that you,
being sent as Russia's saviour, are immune from bodily
harm."</p>

<p>"Ah! but remember when that young fellow shot
at you and grazed two of your fingers at Minsk," remarked
the conjurer with a grin.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so. I don't like this fellow Naglovski
and his friends. I will see Kurloff."</p>

<p>Now, Kurloff was another treacherous bureaucrat, a
creature of Rasputin's, who sat in Protopopoff's Ministry
of the Interior, and who later on collected the gangs of
the "Black Hundred," those hired assassins whom he
clothed in police uniforms and had instructed in machine-gun
practice&mdash;those renegades who played such a sinister
part in the first Revolution.</p>

<p>I then gave the monk the urgent message from the
Empress.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied, "I will be back by Saturday;
not because I obey the woman, but became I must see
Kurloff, and I must take active steps against this Ivan
Naglovski and his accursed friends."</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, when alone in the bare little room
allotted to me, I took out the Empress's letter to the
Starets and re-read it. It was as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Holy Father</span>,&mdash;It is with deepest concern that from
your trusted F&eacute;odor I hear of the plot against you. That
you can be harmed I do not believe. You, sent by God as
Russia's guide to the bright future of civilisation which
Germany will bring to her, cannot be harmed by mere
mortal. But if there are any who dare dispute your divine
right, then, with our dear St&uuml;rmer, take at once drastic
steps to crush them.</p>

<p>"We cannot afford to allow evil tongues to speak of us;
neither can we afford the vulgar scandal that some would
seek to create. If you, O Father, feel apprehensive, then
act boldly in the knowledge that you have your devoted
daughter ever at your side and ever ready and eager to
place her power as Empress in your dear hands. Therefore
strike your enemies swiftly and without fear. Lips prepared
to utter scandal must be, at all costs, silenced.</p>

<p>"Our friend Protopopoff has returned from England and
tells me that Lloyd George and his friends are exerting
every effort to win the war. Those British are brave, but,
oh! if they knew all that we know&mdash;eh? They are in
ignorance, and will remain so until Germany conquers
Russia and spreads the blessing of civilisation among the
people.</p>

<p>"Nikki is returning. A s&eacute;ance is to be held on Saturday.
You must be back in time. He is sending a messenger to
you to urge you to return to us to give us comfort in these
long dark days. Anna and the girls all kiss your dear
hand.&mdash;Your devoted daughter,&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="smcap">Alix</span>."</p></div>

<p>On the following day a middle-aged, fair-haired, rather
well-dressed man, who gave the name of Nicholas Chevitch,
from Okhta, a suburb of Petrograd, was brought to
me by the monk who acted as janitor, and explained that
he had private business with Rasputin.</p>

<p>I left him and, ascending to the monk's room, found
him extremely anxious to meet his visitor.</p>

<p>"I will see him at once, F&eacute;odor. I have some secret
business with him. Here is the key of a small locked
box in your room. Open it and take out ten one-thousand
rouble notes and bring them to me after you have
brought in Chevitch."</p>

<p>This I did. Having admitted the visitor to Rasputin's
presence, I opened the small iron box which the
Starets always carried in his supposed "pilgrimages,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
and took out the money, leaving in it a sum of about
twelve thousand roubles.</p>

<p>The ten thousand I carried to Rasputin, but as I
opened the door I heard the fair-haired man say:</p>

<p>"All is prepared. The wire is laid across the river.
We tested it five days ago and it works excellently."</p>

<p>"Good! Ah, here is my secretary F&eacute;odor!" the
monk exclaimed. "He has the ten thousand roubles
for you, and there will be a further ten thousand on the
day your plan matures."</p>

<p>I wondered to what plan the Starets was referring.
But being compelled to retire I remained in ignorance.
The man Chevitch stayed with the monk for over an
hour, and then left to return to the capital.</p>

<p>Later on I referred to the visit of the stranger, whereupon
Rasputin laughed grimly, saying:</p>

<p>"You will hear some news in a day or two, my dear
F&eacute;odor. Petrograd will be startled."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," he replied. "Wait!"</p>

<p>We arrived back in Petrograd on the following Friday
morning, but although the Empress sent a messenger to
the Gorokhovaya urging the monk to go to Peterhof at
once, as she desired to consult him, he disregarded her
command and did not even vouchsafe a reply. Indeed,
Rasputin treated the poor half-demented Empress with
such scant courtesy that I often stood aghast.</p>

<p>"The woman is an idiot!" he would often exclaim
to me petulantly when she was unusually persistent in
her demands.</p>

<p>Next evening, however, we went to the palace, whither
another French medium, a man named Fournier, had
been summoned, having, of course, been administered
palm-oil to the tune of some thousands of roubles to
give a "message from the dead" in the terms required
by the wire-pullers in Potsdam.</p>

<p>I was not present at the s&eacute;ance, but later that night,
when Rasputin was sitting alone with me over a bottle
of champagne which an "Araby" flunkey had brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
him, he revealed that the "message" from the Tsar's
dead father had been precise and much to the point.</p>

<p>"Nicholas, I speak unto thee," the spirit had said.
"Though thou art brave and thine armies are brave, yet
thine enemies will still encompass thee. Loss will follow
upon loss. The great advance will soon become a retreat,
and the hordes of William will dash forward and
Poland will become German. Yet do not be afraid.
Trust in the good counsel of thy wife Alexandra Feodorovna
and in thy Father Rasputin, whom Heaven hath
sent to thee. Believe no evil word of him, and let his
enemies be swept from his path. Such is my message to
thee, O my son!"</p>

<p>As Rasputin repeated those words with mock
solemnity, he laughed grimly.</p>

<p>The pity of it was that Nicholas, Tsar of All the
Russias, believed in those paid-for messages, uttered
by those presented to him as mediums and able to call
up the spirit of his lamented father.</p>

<p>"Poor idiot!" Rasputin remarked, first glancing to
see that the door was closed. "He must have something
to occupy his shallow brain. That is why the Empress
arranges the sittings. But F&eacute;odor," he added, "I
must see this enemy of mine, Ivan Naglovski. He is
not a person to be disregarded, and it seems from what
you told me he has a number of important friends. We
will discuss the matter to-morrow."</p>

<p>He afterwards dismissed me with a wave of his dirty
hand, and I retired to bed in a room at the farther end
of the long softly carpeted corridor.</p>

<p>At noon next day we had news of a terrible disaster.
Precisely at half-past eleven the city of Petrograd had
been shaken to its foundations by a terrific explosion,
followed by half a dozen others, which shattered windows
and blew down signs and chimneys in all parts of the
city. At first everyone stood aghast as explosion followed
explosion. Then it transpired that the great munition
works at Okhta, across the Neva, opposite the
Smolny Monastery, had suddenly blown up, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
hundreds of workers had been killed and maimed and
the whole of the newly-constructed plant wrecked beyond
repair.</p>

<p>I was just entering Rasputin's room at the palace
when a flunkey told me the news.</p>

<p>When a moment later I informed the Starets he
smiled evilly, remarking:</p>

<p>"Ah! Then that further ten thousand roubles is due
to Nicholas Chevitch. If he calls when we return to
Petrograd this afternoon, you must pay him, F&eacute;odor. He
has done his work well. Russia will be crippled for munitions
for some time to come."</p>

<p>On our return to Petrograd we found the city in the
greatest state of excitement. The succession of explosions
had caused the people to suspect that the disaster
was not due to an accident, as the authorities were fondly
declaring, but the wilful act of the enemy. Rasputin
heard the rumour and piously declared his sympathy with
the poor victims.</p>

<p>Yet we had not been back at the Gorokhovaya an
hour when the man Chevitch called, and at the monk's
orders I handed him the balance of his blood-money.</p>

<p>That same evening Hardt, the secret messenger from
Berlin, arrived, having travelled by way of Ab&ouml;, in Finland.</p>

<p>"I have a very urgent despatch for the Father," he
said when he was ushered in to me, and he handed me a
letter upon strong but flimsy paper, so that it could be
the more easily concealed in transit.</p>

<p>At once I took him up to the monk, who was washing
his hands in his bedroom.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear friend Hardt!" exclaimed the Starets,
greeting him warmly. "And you are straight from
Berlin! Well, how goes it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Excellently well," was the reply of the messenger
from the Secret Service Department in the K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzerstrasse.
"Germany relies upon you to assist us, as we
know you are doing. Count von Wedell has sent you a
letter, which I have handed to your friend F&eacute;odor."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
"Read it, F&eacute;odor," said the monk. "There are no
secrets in it that may be hidden from our dear friend
Hardt."</p>

<p>He spoke the truth. Hardt was the confidential messenger
who passed between the Emperor William and
Alexandra Feodorovna, and nowadays he was travelling
to and fro to Germany always, notwithstanding that
Russia was at war with her neighbour.</p>

<p>At Rasputin's bidding I tore open the letter, but found
it to be written in cipher.</p>

<p>Therefore I sat down at the little desk and at once
commenced to decode it. It was in the German spy-cipher,
the same used all over the world by German secret
agents&mdash;the most simple yet at the same time the most
marvellous and complicated code that the world has
ever known.</p>

<p>The keys to the code were in twelve sentences that
one committed to memory. Hence no code-book need ever
be carried. The cipher message, in its introduction, told
its recipient the number of the sentences being used&mdash;a
most ingenious mode of correspondence.</p>

<p>With the paper before me I discovered that in sentence
number eight I would find the key. The sentence in
question, a proverb something like "Faint heart never
won fair lady," I wrote down, and then at once began to
decipher the cryptic message from Berlin.</p>

<p>And I read out the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Memorandum No. 43,286.</span></p>

<p class="figcenter">"From No. 70 to the Holy Father.</p>

<p>"If the blowing up of the Okhta Munition Works is
successful, endeavour to get your friend C. [Chevitch] to do
similar work at the new explosive factory at Olonetz, where
a sub-inspector named Lemeneff is one of our friends. Tell
this to C. and let them get into touch with each other.</p>

<p>"We approve of C.'s suggestion to destroy the battleship
<i>Cheliabinsk</i>, and it is suggested that this be carried out at
the same price paid for Okhta.</p>

<p>"From what we are informed you are in some danger
from a man named Naglovski, who has shown himself far
too curious concerning you of late. Steps should be taken
against him.&mdash;Greetings,&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;W."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
The initial, I knew, stood for von Wedell, one of the
directors at the K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzerstrasse.</p>

<p>Rasputin heard me through, and, taking the cipher
message, applied a match to it, after which Hardt, having
swallowed a glass of vodka, left us.</p>

<p>But the monk, as a result of that message, was at
once aroused to evil activity, and by means of a clever
ruse invited Ivan Naglovski to dinner next day. He
accepted, hoping, of course, to discover more concerning
the monk, and quite unconscious that Rasputin knew of
his hostile intentions. To dinner there were invited the
Prime Minister, Boris St&uuml;rmer, and a sycophant of his
named Sikstel. St&uuml;rmer was in uniform and Sikstel in
civilian attire. Naglovski, I found, was a youngish man,
who, when I introduced him, appeared highly honoured to
meet at Rasputin's table the Prime Minister of Russia,
while the monk went out of his way to ingratiate himself
with his enemy. Naglovski and his friends had been preparing
a plot either to expose or assassinate the monk,
hence the head of the conspiracy was congratulating himself
that the plot was unsuspected by anybody.</p>

<p>The dinner passed off quite merrily until, of a sudden,
St&uuml;rmer, addressing his fellow-guest, said:</p>

<p>"News has been conveyed to the holy Father that
you and your friends have formed a plot against him.
Is that true?"</p>

<p>Naglovski started and turned pale. For a moment
he was taken entirely off his guard.</p>

<p>"Ah!" went on St&uuml;rmer in his deep, thick voice,
Rasputin having risen to go to the sideboard, "I see it
is true. Now, what can you gain by endeavouring to belittle
the efforts of our dear Father for the salvation of
Russia? Think. Are you patriots? No. Well," he
went on, "the reason the Father has invited you here to-night
is to come to terms with you. For a list of your
friends&mdash;a secret list that will be afterwards destroyed&mdash;the
Starets will pay you twenty thousand roubles, and,
further, I will give you a diplomatic appointment in one
of the embassies abroad&mdash;wherever you desire."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
"What!" cried the young man. "You ask me to
betray my friends to that blasphemous rascal!" and he
pointed his finger at Rasputin, who moved aside.
"Never! I refuse! And, further, I tell you," he
shouted, rising as he spoke, "I intend to expose the
mock-saint and his conjuring tricks; the criminal miracle-worker
who, according to secret information I have just
received, was the actual instigator of the terrible disaster
at Okhta. This is what my friends, when I reveal to
them the truth, will expose."</p>

<p>As Ivan Naglovski uttered his biting condemnation
Rasputin had crept up behind him, and drawing his revolver
suddenly cried in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Enough! You don't leave this house alive. Gregory
Rasputin knows how to crush his enemies, never fear.
All your friends will share your fate. Take that!"</p>

<p>And he fired, the bullet striking the unfortunate man
in the back, where it entered a vital spot.</p>

<p>Two hours later the body of Ivan Naglovski was discovered
on some waste ground out at Kushelevka, on the
other side of the city. Though the Director of Secret
Police guessed what had occurred, he pretended that it
was a complete and unfathomable mystery&mdash;and a
mystery it has ever remained until this present exposure.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">poison plots that failed</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the spring of 1916 Rasputin, though constantly revealing
himself as a blasphemous blackguard, had become
the greatest power in Russia.</p>

<p>His name was whispered by the awe-stricken people.
All Russia, from the Empress down to the most illiterate
mujik, accepted him as divine and swallowed any lie
he might utter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
The weekly meetings of the "sister-disciples" were
becoming more popular than ever in Petrograd society,
and there were many converts to the new "religion."</p>

<p>One evening a reunion for recruiting purposes was
held by the old Baroness Guerbel at her big house in
the Potemkinskaya. The yellow-toothed, loud-speaking
old lady had been persistent in her appeals to Rasputin
to hold one of his meetings at her house, and he had,
with ill-grace, acceded. On fully a dozen occasions
the baroness, who was a close friend of old Countess
Ignatieff, had interviewed me and endeavoured to enlist
my services on her behalf. At last the monk had said
to me:</p>

<p>"Well, F&eacute;odor, if the old hag is so very persistent,
I suppose I had better spend an evening at her house
and inspect her lady friends."</p>

<p>Thus it had been arranged, the "saint" little dreaming
of the outcome of that fateful reunion.</p>

<p>It seems that Baroness Guerbel had arranged it
because she wished to introduce to Rasputin a certain
Madame Yatchevski&mdash;the wife of an officer who was very
rich&mdash;who saw that, by Rasputin's influence, she could
aspire to a position at Court.</p>

<p>Olga Yatchevski proved to be a pretty, fair-haired
little woman of girlish figure and sweet expression, and
from the moment of their introduction the unkempt monk,
after crossing himself and uttering a benediction, became
greatly interested in her, the result being that she became
an "aspirant," and her initiation into the secrets
of the cult was arranged to take place on the following
Wednesday.</p>

<p>The meeting ended, the dozen or so neurotic women,
all of them of the highest society in the capital, each
bent and kissed the unwashed hand of Russia's "saviour,"
as was their habit, and when they had gone the monk
sat down and drank half a bottle of brandy served to
him by his ugly old hostess.</p>

<p>Next night I happened to be out at the theatre when
Rasputin, who was alone, emerged to walk round to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
professional blackmailer named Ivan Scheseleff, who lived
in the Rozhsky Prospekt. Suddenly he was set upon
by three Cossacks&mdash;afterwards found to have been men
hired by Madame Yatchevski's husband&mdash;who, hustling
the "saint" into a narrow side street, gagged him,
stripped him of the silk blouse embroidered by the
Tsaritza's own hands, his wide velvet breeches, and his
beautiful boots of patent leather.</p>

<p>Then they drew a knout and administered to the
rascal a sound drubbing, afterwards binding him with
rope and shutting him up in a neighbouring stableyard,
attired only in his underwear!</p>

<p>His clothes they packed up in a cardboard box and
delivered to Yatchevski, who, having sealed it, sent it
by special messenger to Tsarskoe-Selo, where it was
delivered into the Empress's own hands.</p>

<p>Alexandra Feodorovna, on having it opened and discovering
the insult to her "holy Father," waxed furious.
Meanwhile, Rasputin had been discovered, and was at
home foaming at the mouth at the indignity. He, "the
saviour of Russia," had been thrashed and degraded!</p>

<p>At two o'clock that morning he took a car to the
palace, and I accompanied him. He had an interview
with Her Majesty, who was attired in a rich dressing-gown
of pale-blue silk, and the pair resolved upon a
rigid inquiry regarding the affair.</p>

<p>"It is monstrous that you, our dear Father, should
have such enemies about you! We will crush them!"
she declared angrily. "I will see Nikki about it in the
morning. To send me your clothes is a personal insult
to myself. It is abominable! These people shall suffer!"</p>

<p>That night we remained at the palace, and next
morning Protopopoff was called from Petrograd and informed
by the Empress of what had occurred. Later the
Minister came to the room wherein I was writing at the
monk's dictation, and promised that the whole of the
machinery of the Secret Police should be set in motion
to discover the perpetrators of the outrage.</p>

<p>Rasputin knew that many of the husbands of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
devotees were enraged against him; therefore he could
not, at the moment, suggest any particular person who
had plotted the affair, and probably the police would
have failed to obtain any information had not Captain
Yatchevski himself boasted in the Officers' Club of how
he had had the Tsaritza's pet "saint" stripped and
thrashed.</p>

<p>In Petrograd the very walls had ears; therefore within
three hours the "saint" knew the identity of the instigator
of the outrage, and gave his name to the
Empress.</p>

<p>"We will make an example of him," she said. "Otherwise
it may be repeated. I leave it to you, dear Father,
to take what reprisals you wish. In any course you
adopt you will have the full authority of both Nikki
and myself."</p>

<p>For nearly a week Rasputin was undecided as to
how he should wreak vengeance upon the unfortunate
Yatchevski, whose wife had by this time become one
of the monk's most devoted "sisters."</p>

<p>On two or three occasions he went to the Minister of
War and chatted with the traitor, General Soukhomlinoff.</p>

<p>Once he remarked to me, after a meeting of the
"disciples" at our house in the Gorokhovaya:</p>

<p>"That captain shall pay&mdash;and pay dearly&mdash;for his
insult! Think!&mdash;only think of it, F&eacute;odor&mdash;of sending my
clothes to Her Majesty! What must she have thought!
To me it seems that she doubts whether I can take
care of myself. And am I not inspired, divine!&mdash;sent
as the saviour of Russia, and immune from the attacks
of mankind!"</p>

<p>His subtle mujik mind clearly saw the bad impression
which must be produced upon the woman who was so
completely beneath the thraldom of his hypnotic eyes.
If he could be beaten as a charlatan, then such action
of his enemies must naturally create a doubt in her mind.
Hence he was scheming to exhibit his power.</p>

<p>The worst feature of the position was that from
the Officers' Club the incident had leaked out all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
Petrograd, until it had become common talk in the caf&eacute;s.
The story of Grichka sitting upon a dung-heap was
on the lips of everybody, while a well-known member
of the Duma remarked:</p>

<p>"A pity he was not buried in it, never to see the
light of day again!"</p>

<p>Yatchevski was, of course, unconscious of the knowledge
held by the monk. He was at the Ministry of
War, head of one of its many departments, a loyal
patriotic Russian, who, like our millions, believed that
Soukhomlinoff was "out to win." He was ignorant of
the irresistible power which the dirty "saint" could wield.</p>

<p>One day, to Captain Yatchevski's delight, he found
himself raised in rank and appointed military commandant
of the town of Kaluga, south of Moscow, with permission
to take his wife to reside there. Naturally he was
gratified to receive so influential an appointment. Though
possessed of much money, he had hitherto not progressed
very far in his official career, and this favour shown
him by the Tsar, who had made the appointment, pleased
him immensely.</p>

<p>His wife, of course, felt otherwise. She would be
separated from her gay friends, the "sisters" of the
monk's "religion." Besides, she saw that by entering
Rasputin's cult there was a prospect of becoming on
terms of personal friendship with the Empress.</p>

<p>Anyhow, a week later Olga Yatchevski, having bidden
farewell to the monk, was forced to depart with her
husband to the important town of Kaluga, and for a
fortnight I heard nothing.</p>

<p>One morning, however, the monk received a certain
General Nicholas Ganetski, of the Imperial General Staff,
when, without much preamble, the officer remarked:</p>

<p>"The warning you gave us concerning Yatchevski has
proved quite true. He has been in communication with
a German agent in Riga named Kl&ouml;ss."</p>

<p>"Ah! I was quite certain of it, General," remarked
the "holy" man, with a sinister grin. "I discovered
it quite by accident. Well, what have you done?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
"He and his wife are both under preventive arrest,
pending an Imperial order. The papers we seized are
conclusive. Among them was the enemy spy code. The
whole case is quite clear, and there can be no defence."</p>

<p>"Then there will be a court-martial?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I have ordered it to be held on the
seventeenth, in Moscow."</p>

<p>"They are both clever agents of Germany," the monk
remarked. "Be careful that they do not slip through
your fingers."</p>

<p>"No fear of that, Father," replied the general.
"Possession of the German code is in itself sufficient
to secure them conviction and sentence."</p>

<p>The latter was indeed pronounced ten days later.
The little fair-haired woman, who was so devoted to
Rasputin, and who frantically appealed to him in vain
to save her, was sentenced to imprisonment for life at
Yakutsk, in Eastern Siberia, while her husband, condemned
for treason, was next day shot in a barrack
square behind the Kremlin in Moscow.</p>

<p>Truly, Gregory the Monk swept with drastic and
relentless hand any enemy who crossed his path.</p>

<p>It was about a week after I heard of the execution
of the Governor of Kaluga that I happened to be at
Tsarskoe-Selo again with my evil-faced master, being
busy writing in the luxurious little room allotted to him.</p>

<p>Madame Vyrubova had been with us, discussing the
condition of health of the heir to the throne, when,
after she had left, there entered quite unexpectedly the
Emperor himself.</p>

<p>"Gregory," he said, standing by the window, attired
in the rather faded navy serge suit he sometimes wore
when busy in his private cabinet, "I have been told
to-day that the Holy Synod are once again agitating
against you. From what St&uuml;rmer has said an hour ago
it appears that the Church has become jealous of your
friendship with my wife and myself. I really cannot
understand this. Why should it be so? As our divine
guide in the war against our relentless enemies, we look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
to you to lead us along the path of victory. Alexandra
Feodorovna has been telling me to-day some strange
tales of subtle intrigue, and how the Church is uniting
to endeavour to destroy your popularity with the people
and your position here at our Court."</p>

<p>"Thou hast it in thy power to judge me by my works,"
was the monk's grave reply, crossing himself piously and
repeating a benediction beneath his breath. "Gregory
is but the servant of the Almighty God, sent unto thee
to guide and direct thee and thy nation against those
who seek to destroy and dismember the Empire. Cannot
I have the names of those of the Church who are
seeking my downfall? Surely it is but just to myself
if thou wouldst furnish them to me? Personally, I
entertain no hope."</p>

<p>"No hope!" cried the Tsar, starting. "What do
you mean, Father? Explain."</p>

<p>"No hope of victory for Russia, surrounded as she
is on all sides by those who are conspiring to do thee
evil. Against thee the Church is ever plotting. As
Starets&mdash;I know!"</p>

<p>"And the Procurator?"</p>

<p>"He is thy friend."</p>

<p>"And the Bishop Teofan? Surely he is not a
traitor?"</p>

<p>"No. For years I have known him. Trust Teofan,
but make an end of the ecclesiastical camarilla which
is against thee."</p>

<p>"How can I? I do not know them?" was the
Emperor's reply.</p>

<p>"I tell thee plainly that if matters are allowed to
proceed, the Church, suborned by German gold as it is,
will contrive to defeat our arms. Hence it behoves
thee to act&mdash;and act immediately!"</p>

<p>The Tsar, his hands in the pockets of his jacket,
stood silent.</p>

<p>"Because by divine grace I possess the power of
healing, thy Church is jealous of me," Rasputin went
on. "The Holy Synod is seeking my overthrow! Always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
have I acted for the benefit of mankind. But the
Russian Church seeks to drive me forth. Therefore, I
must bow to the inevitable&mdash;and I will depart!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, Gregory! We cannot spare you, our dear
Father," declared the Emperor. "This ecclesiastical
interference we will tolerate no longer. You must help
me. I give carte blanche to you to dismiss those of
the Church who are disloyal and your enemies and mine,
and replace them by those who are our friends, and
in whom I can place my trust."</p>

<p>"In the sweeping clean of the Church thou wilt find
many surprises," replied the monk, elated at the success
of his clever reasoning.</p>

<p>"No doubt. I know that the Empress and myself
are surrounded by enemies. Plots are everywhere. Is
not Protopopoff continuous in his declaration that the
Church is against me? I know it&mdash;alas! too well. And
I leave its reformation entirely to you, dear Father."</p>

<p>Reformation! Within twelve hours Rasputin, who
dictated to me over fifty letters, and had, in the name
of the Emperor, dismissed most of the higher Church
dignitaries in various parts of Russia, the new Procurator
of the Holy Synod having been appointed by
him only a few weeks before.</p>

<p>Bishop Teofan, who had commenced life as a gardener,
who had been convicted as a criminal by the
court of Tobolsk, and whose sister was a "disciple" at
Pokrovsky, held a long conference with the "saint"
lasting well into the night. Truly, they were the most
precious pair of unholy scoundrels in all Europe, both
being in the immediate entourage of Their Majesties,
and both pretending to lead "holy" lives, though they
were gloriously drunk each evening.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, within forty-eight hours of Rasputin's
conversation with the Tsar, the Church of Russia had
been swept clean of all its loyal adherents, and in their
places&mdash;even in the bishoprics of Kazan, Tver and Odessa&mdash;were
appointed alcoholic rascals of the same calibre
as Rasputin himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
Is it, then, any wonder that Holy Russia has fallen?</p>

<p>Indeed, the new bishop of Kazan was, three days
after his appointment, found one night riotously drunk
in one of the principal streets in the city, and, as he
was wearing ordinary clothes, was arrested by the police,
who did not recognise him, so that the precious prelate
spent the night in a cell! Such was our dear Russia in
the midst of her valiant struggle against the Hun!</p>

<p>My dissolute master, possessed as he was of superhuman
cunning, held the Empire in the hollow of his
hand. He could make or break the most powerful
statesman within a single day. In that small fireproof
safe of his, concealed beneath the floor of the wine-cellar
at the Gorokhovaya&mdash;that safe in which were
preserved so many amorous letters from neurotic women
whom the monk intended later on to blackmail&mdash;was
also much documentary evidence of the "saint's" vile
plots, correspondence which, later on, fell into the hands
of the revolutionary party, who revealed only a portion
of it after Rasputin's tragic end.</p>

<p>Possessed of inordinate greed, the monk had a mania
for amassing wealth, yet what really became of his money
was to me always a mystery. Though he would have
a balance of a million or so roubles at his bank to-day,
yet the day after to-morrow his pass-book showed payments
of mysterious sums, which would deplete his funds
until often he had perhaps but a single thousand roubles.</p>

<p>Into what channel went all that money which he
received for bribery, for creating appointments, and for
suggesting that young men of good family should be
given sinecures, I was never able to discover.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe he paid certain persons whose
wives were "disciples" hush-money. But his power was
such that I could never see why he should do so. Yet
the mujik mind always works in a mysterious way.</p>

<p>The true facts concerning the desperate conspiracy
against Generals Brusiloff and Korniloff have never been
told, though several French writers have attempted to
reveal them, and the revolutionists themselves have en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>deavoured
to delve into the mystery. As secretary to
the Starets, I am able to disclose the actual and most
amazing truth.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by my readers that General
Brusiloff, early in June, 1916, had his four armies well
in hand, and made a superhuman effort to defeat the
Central Powers between the Pripet and the Roumanian
frontier. He was a fearless and brilliant tactician, and
within two months had succeeded in capturing 7,757
officers and 350,845 men, with 805 guns&mdash;and remember
that this was in face of all the obstacles that the
Minister of War, who was working with Rasputin as
Germany's friend, had placed in his way.</p>

<p>Brusiloff had done splendidly. No Russian general
has eclipsed him in this war. He performed miracles of
strategy, and Berlin had very naturally become genuinely
alarmed. All their negotiations with St&uuml;rmer, Protopopoff,
Rasputin and others of the "Black Force" had
apparently been of no avail. They had staked millions
of roubles, but without much result. Our armies were
advancing, and the combined German and Austrian
forces were daily being entrapped into the marshes or
forced back.</p>

<p>Even Rasputin realised the seriousness of the position,
and more than once referred to it.</p>

<p>Early one morning, before I was up, Hardt, the
secret messenger from Berlin, arrived.</p>

<p>After greeting me, he informed me that he had an
urgent secret despatch for the Father&mdash;to be delivered
only into his own hands. Therefore I at once conducted
the travel-worn messenger to Rasputin's bedroom,
where he delivered a crumpled letter from the belt which
he wore next his skin.</p>

<p>"Read it to me, F&eacute;odor," said the "saint," sitting up
in bed and rubbing his eyes after a drunken sleep.</p>

<p>Opening it, I found it to be in a code in what was known
as "Sentence number seven"&mdash;words which, truth to tell,
spelt an ancient Russian proverb, which translated into
English means: "Actions befit men; words befit women."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
Taking a pencil, I sat down, and after ten minutes
or so, during which time the monk chatted with Hardt,
I succeeded in deciphering the message, which ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"T. F. 6,823&mdash;88.</p>

<p>"Memorandum from 'No. 70.'&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<i>Secret and Private.</i></p>

<p>"Further to the memorandum F. G. 2,734&mdash;22, it is deemed
of greatest and most immediate importance that the Pripet
offensive should at once cease. You will recollect that in
your reply you made a promise that the offensive was to be
turned into a defeat within fourteen days. But this has not
been done, and a certain Personage [the Kaiser] is greatly
dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"The advance must not continue, and we send you
further secret instructions, herewith enclosed. Lose no time
in carrying them out.</p>

<p>"We hope you have not overlooked the instructions contained
in F. G. 2,734&mdash;22, especially regarding the destruction
of the munition factories at Vologda and Bologoye. It
is a pity you have allowed K. [Kartzoff, who blew up the
explosive works at Viborg, where four hundred lives were
lost] to be shot. He was extremely useful. The woman
Raevesky, who was his assistant, was not in love with him,
as you reported. She would have assisted him further if
allowed her liberty. We wonder you were not more correctly
informed. Payment of 500,000 roubles will be made to your
bank on the 18th from Melnitzzki and Company of Nijni
Novgorod.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;S."</p></div>

<p>Enclosed was a sheet of pale yellow paper, upon
which had been typed in Russian the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Secret Instructions.</i>&mdash;(1) You are to double the promised
payment to Nicholas Meder and Irene Feischer for the
blowing up of the works at Vologda and Bologoye, on condition
that the affair is carried out within fourteen days of
the receipt of this. If not, arrange with your friend P.
[Protopopoff] to have both arrested with incriminating
papers upon them. They may become dangerous to us
unless implicated.</p>

<p>"(2) As you have failed to carry out the plans against
Generals Brusiloff and Korniloff, then you must adopt other
means against both generals, and thus ensure a lull upon the
frontier. We note that the attempt made by Brusiloff's
body-servant, Ivan Sawvitch, has unfortunately failed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
"The bearer of this will hand you a small packet. It
contains two tubes of white powder. Peter Tchernine, who
has succeeded Sawvitch as the general's servant, is to be
trusted. You will send the tube marked No. 1 to him in
secret at General Headquarters, with orders to mix the
contents with the powdered sugar which the general is in
the habit of taking with stewed fruit. The slightest trace
of the powder will result in death from a cause which it will
be impossible for the doctors to identify.</p>

<p>"(3) A young dancer at the Bouffes named Nada
Tsourikoff, living in the Garnovskaya, will call upon you
for the tube marked No. 2. She is a close friend of General
Korniloff, and is about to join him at headquarters at our
orders. She has already her instructions as to the use of
the tube. The two deaths will be entirely different, therefore
doctors will never suspect.</p>

<p>"At all hazards the offensive must be ended. Greetings.</p>
<p class="fsc">"S."&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p></div>

<p>After I had read the instructions Hardt produced a
box of Swedish safety matches, which he emptied upon
the table, and among them we saw two tiny tubes of glass
hermetically sealed, one containing a white chalk-like
powder and numbered "1," while the other was half filled
with pale green powder and marked "2." These he
handed to the monk, saying:</p>

<p>"I will use your telephone, if I may? I have to ask
the young woman Nada Tsourikoff to call here to see
you."</p>

<p>The monk having granted permission, Hardt, passing
into the study, was soon speaking with the popular young
dancer of the Bouffes.</p>

<p>"You will call here at noon, eh?" he asked, to which
she gave a response in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Punctually at twelve I was informed that a young
lady, who refused her name, desired to have an urgent
interview with the Starets, and on going to the waiting-room,
wherein so many of the fair sex sat daily in patience
for the Father to receive them, I found a tall, willowy,
dark-haired and exceedingly handsome girl, who, after
inquiring if I were F&eacute;odor Rajevski, told me that her
name was Tsourikoff and that she had been sent to see the
Father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
Without delay I introduced her to the "holy" man,
who stood with his hands crossed over his breast in his
most pious attitude.</p>

<p>"My daughter, you have, I believe, been sent to me
by our mutual friend," he said. "You wish for something?
Here it is," and he produced a small oblong
cardboard box such as jewellers use for men's scarf-pins.
Opening it, he showed her the tiny tube reposing in pink
cotton wool. "It is a little present for somebody, eh?"
he asked with a sinister laugh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied the girl as she took it and placed
it carefully in the black silk vanity-bag she was carrying.</p>

<p>"You have already received instructions through another
channel?" inquired Rasputin.</p>

<p>"I have, O Father," was her reply.</p>

<p>"Then be extremely careful of it. Let not a grain of
it touch you," he said. "I am ordered to tell you that."</p>

<p>She promised to exercise the greatest care.</p>

<p>"And when you have fulfilled your mission come to me
again," he said, fixing her with his sinister, hypnotic
eyes, beneath the cold intense gaze of which I saw that
she was trembling. "Remember that!&mdash;perform what is
expected of you fearlessly, but with complete discretion,
and instantly on your return to Petrograd call here and
report to me."</p>

<p>The girl promised, and then, kissing the dirty paw
which the monk held out to her, she withdrew.</p>

<p>"Good-looking&mdash;extremely good-looking, F&eacute;odor," the
monk remarked as soon as she had gone. "She might be
very useful to me in the near future." Then after a
pause he added: "Ring up His Excellency the Minister
of War and ask where Brusiloff is at the present
moment."</p>

<p>I did so, and after a short wait found myself talking
to General Soukhomlinoff, who told me that the Russian
commander was that day at headquarters at Minsk.</p>

<p>When I told the monk, he said: "You must go there
at once, F&eacute;odor, and carry the little tube to the Cossack
Peter Tchernine, who is now Brusiloff's body-servant."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
"I!" I gasped, startled at the suggestion that I
should be chosen to convey death to our gallant commander.</p>

<p>"Yes. And pray why not? Someone whom I can
trust must act as messenger. And I trust you above all
men, F&eacute;odor."</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated.</p>

<p>Then I thanked him for his expression of confidence,
but he at once noticed the reluctance which I had endeavoured
to conceal.</p>

<p>"Surely, F&eacute;odor, you are not hesitating to perform
this service for the Fatherland? Think of all the sacrifices
we are making to bring the benefit of German civilisation
into Russia," added the pious scoundrel.</p>

<p>"I will go&mdash;certainly I will go," I said. "But I cannot
leave to-day. I shall require papers from the
Ministry ere I can travel."</p>

<p>"His Excellency the General will order them to be
furnished to you," he said. "I will see to it at once."</p>

<p>And five minutes later he went out to seek the
Minister.</p>

<p>I was horrified at my position, compelled as I was to
convey the means of death to the hands of the German
spy Tchernine, who had been placed as servant to the
Russian commander. I saw that I must leave Petrograd
for Minsk that night; therefore I set about preparing
for my adventurous journey. Indeed, shortly before midnight
I left the Gorokhovaya with the box of Swedish
matches in my inner pocket.</p>

<p>The journey from Petrograd due south to Polotzk,
where I had to change, proved an interminable one and
occupied nearly two days, so congested was the line by
military traffic and ambulance trains. At last on arrival
there I joined a troop-train with reinforcements going to
Minsk, where I duly alighted, to discover that General
Brusiloff's headquarters were out at a village called
Gorodok, about five miles distant, in the direction of
Vilna. The evening was bitterly cold, and as I drove
along I became filled with ineffable disgust of Rasputin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
and the disgraceful camarilla who were slowly but surely
hurling the nation to its doom.</p>

<p>Had I refused to undertake that devilish mission, the
monk would have instantly suspected me of double
dealing, and sooner or later I should have met with an
untimely end, as, alas! so many others had done. So
completely had he placed me beneath his thumb that I
was compelled to act as he dictated, in order to save my
own life, for, as I have already explained, the "holy"
man held the lives of those who displeased him very
cheaply.</p>

<p>At headquarters, which proved to be a veritable hive
of military activity, I posed to a sergeant as Tchernine's
brother, and begged that I might see him. It was nearly
dark as I stood with the man, who had roughly demanded
my business there.</p>

<p>"I fear you will not be able to see him," he replied.
"The Emperor has just arrived on a visit to headquarters,
and he is with the general, and your brother is in attendance
upon them."</p>

<p>Tchernine, a spy of Germany, was actually in attendance
upon the Emperor, and hence could listen to the
conversation between His Majesty and the army commander!</p>

<p>"But I have come all the way from Petrograd," I
whined. "I have a message to give my brother from his
wife, whom I fear is dying."</p>

<p>This moved the honest sergeant, who, calling one of
his men, told him to go to Tchernine and tell him he was
wanted immediately.</p>

<p>"Only for a few moments," I said. "I will not keep
him from his duty more than two or three minutes&mdash;just
to give him the message."</p>

<p>I waited alone in a small, bare hut for nearly half an
hour, when the man returned with Brusiloff's servant.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear brother Peter!" I cried, rushing forward
and embracing him ere he could express astonishment.
"So I have found you at last&mdash;at last!"</p>

<p>As I expected, the man who had accompanied him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
not wishing to be present at the meeting, turned and left
us alone.</p>

<p>The instant he had gone I pressed the box of matches
into his hand, whispering:</p>

<p>"Take this. It has been sent to you from our friends
in Berlin. Inside is a tube of white powder, which you
will mix with the powdered sugar which General Brusiloff
takes with fruit. It is highly dangerous, so be very
careful how you handle it. Death will occur quickly, but
the doctors will never discover the reason. It has already
been used with effect by our friends among the Allies."</p>

<p>"I understand," was the spy's grim reply. "Tell our
friends that I will put it into the sugar to-night, and
both His Majesty and the general shall have some. How
fortunate, eh?" he grinned.</p>

<p>I held my breath. It had never crossed my mind that
Nicholas was to dine with the general.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "Keep it till to-morrow, so that the
general has it alone. It is intended for him. Those are
the instructions."</p>

<p>"I shall not," was his reply as he placed the box in
his pocket. "If one has it, so shall the other. The German
advance will be made all the more easy by the
removal of both of them. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded outside, and the sergeant appeared
an instant later; hence we were compelled to separate
after exchanging farewells as good brothers would.</p>

<p>Back to Minsk I drove rapidly, and two hours later
was in an ambulance train on my way to Petrograd, full
of wonder as to what was happening at Gorodok.</p>

<p>Peter Tchernine, spy of Germany, had no doubt mixed
the contents of that tiny tube with the powdered sugar
served to the general and his Imperial guest.</p>

<p>Standing alone at the end of a long ambulance carriage,
I leaned out of the window, breathing the fresh
air of the open plain. We were running beside a lake,
the water of which came up close to the rails. Here was
my opportunity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
I took a tin matchbox from my pocket and flung it
as far as I could into the water.</p>

<p>Then I returned to my seat, my heart lighter, for at
last I had saved the life of our dear general, and also
that of His Majesty, for, truth to tell, what I had given
Peter Tchernine was only a little tube of French chalk
made up to resemble that brought so secretly from Berlin.</p>

<p>On reporting to Rasputin next day, he rubbed his
hands with delight. I, of course, did not tell him of the
Emperor's peril.</p>

<p>Next day he, however, came to me in a state of high
indignation.</p>

<p>"The fool Tchernine has blundered, just as Sawvitch
did!" he cried. "Brusiloff still lives and is continuing
the offensive. Did he not promise to use the
tube?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did," I assured the monk. "He was
filled with satisfaction that he would be able thus to
help the Fatherland."</p>

<p>"In any case he has failed!" said the "holy" man.
"Not only that, but the plot against Korniloff has also
failed. What shall I reply to Berlin? What will they
say?"</p>

<p>"Has the girl Nada Tsourikoff failed us, then?" I
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied in a hard, deep tone. "The little
fool apparently had no courage. It failed her at the last
moment&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?"</p>

<p>"Or somebody knew the truth and threatened exposure."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because she was found dead yesterday morning at
the Grand Hotel at Dvinsk, having broken the tube and
taken some of its contents in her tea. A pity, too, F&eacute;odor,
for she might have been so very useful." Then he
added: "Bah! it is always the same with women,
their courage fails them at the last moment! No. It is
men&mdash;men like yourself, F&eacute;odor&mdash;that we want. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
failure at Minsk is, however, very strange. We must
inquire into Tchernine's actions and report fully to the
K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzerstrasse. Otherwise I shall once again be
blamed. Surely I did my best&mdash;and so did you!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">rasputin and the kaiser</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> secret visit of Rasputin to Berlin and his second
audience with the Kaiser were stoutly denied at the time,
but as I accompanied the "saint" upon his adventurous
journey I am in a position to know the exact facts.</p>

<p>He, dressed as a Dutch pastor, and calling himself
Pastor van Meuwen, and I, calling myself Koster,
arrived at a small quiet hotel called the Westf&auml;lischer-Hof,
in the Neustadische-strasse, on the north of the
Linden. We had travelled by way of Helsingfors, Stockholm,
and Hamburg, Rasputin being bearer of letters
from the Tsaritza to the Kaiser and Kaiserin, assuring
them of her continued good wishes and her efforts to
secure a German conquest.</p>

<p>Hardly had we been in the rather dismal hotel an hour
when a waiter introduced into our private sitting-room,
where I stood alone, a tall, dark, middle-aged man,
who clicked his heels as he bowed elegantly before me.</p>

<p>Smiling, and without uttering a word, my visitor
handed me half of a plain visiting-card that had been
roughly torn across, after I had scribbled my signature
across the back. From my cigarette-case I took the
other half, and placing them together, ascertained that
they fitted. The torn portion that the Baron von Hausen&mdash;for
that was his name, I learnt&mdash;had handed to me
had been conveyed to Berlin by Hardt a month before,
in order that we might repose confidence in any person
who called upon us and bore it as the credential of the
K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzerstrasse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
My visitor was a pleasant, shrewd-eyed man, well
dressed and wearing a fine diamond in his black cravat,
who, when he had seated himself at my invitation,
glanced to see if the door was closed, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, Herr Koster, I trust that the Father and yourself
have had a comfortable journey."</p>

<p>"Quite," I replied. "But, of course, it is a very
roundabout route."</p>

<p>"I expected you two days ago," said the baron, who
at that moment rose at the entry of Rasputin and greeted
him.</p>

<p>The appearance of the monk in Berlin was very different
from the figure he presented in Petrograd. His
hair and beard had been trimmed, he had washed, and
in his clerical garb he looked a typical Dutch pastor.</p>

<p>I introduced the pair, whereupon the baron said:</p>

<p>"His Majesty the Emperor wishes you to come to
Potsdam at four o'clock to-morrow afternoon. You are
to meet the Chancellor."</p>

<p>To this the monk agreed, saying in his halting
German:</p>

<p>"It is not the first time I have been received by His
Majesty. I shall bring F&eacute;odor."</p>

<p>"As you wish. But I question if His Majesty will
allow him to be present at the audience."</p>

<p>"In that case, Baron, tell His Majesty that I shall
not come," remarked the "saint" bluntly. "His
Majesty the Tsar permits the presence of my secretary,
therefore why should your Emperor object? Give him
that message," he said, adding: "I have little time to
spare here in Berlin, and am returning to Petrograd
almost at once."</p>

<p>The Baron von Hausen demurred, but Rasputin insisted
on his message being given to the Kaiser.</p>

<p>Then, when our visitor had left, the monk helped
himself to a stiff glass of brandy, and laughing said:</p>

<p>"The only way to treat these Germans is with dignity,
F&eacute;odor. I want you to note all he says and translate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
the most important into Russian for me. Why does
Bethmann-Hollweg want to be present, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"To advise the Kaiser, no doubt."</p>

<p>"About what? I will deal with His Majesty himself,
and nobody else," he snapped.</p>

<p>Even while we were discussing the situation another
caller came, a German, also dressed as a pastor, who
gave the name of Schwass. In a moment Rasputin,
recognising him, locked the door and, turning quickly,
asked in Russian:</p>

<p>"Well, how do things go? You are not suspected?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," was the reply of the man, who had
been an agent of the Russian Secret Police, and who
was now a spy living in Berlin under a clerical guise.</p>

<p>"You have a letter for me, I believe, Father, from
the Minister Protopopoff, have you not?" he asked.</p>

<p>I unlocked the small attach&eacute; case and from among a
number of other letters which we had brought from
Russia was one in a plain envelope addressed to the
Pastor Wilhelm Schwass.</p>

<p>The spy tore it open, read it through carefully three
times, and then placed it in the fire and watched until it
was consumed. What the instructions were we knew
not. They were evidently unwelcome, for the man's face
went grey, and scarcely uttering another word he turned
and left us.</p>

<p>After dinner, which we took together in our sitting-room,
we went out for a walk in the Linden. Rasputin
was eager to go to one or other of the variety entertainments,
but I dissuaded him from such an action, he
being in clerical attire.</p>

<p>"If you go you may arouse the curiosity of some stupid
policeman, and inquiries might be made concerning us.
No, while in Berlin it will be necessary for you to remain
very quiet," I urged. "Remember, the baron and certain
of his friends are watching us."</p>

<p>So we idled along to the Caf&eacute; Bauer, where we spent
an hour watching the gay crowd, among whom were a
number of convalescent officers with those in the capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
on leave from Flanders. Berlin life seemed quite unchanged,
and the war had not by any means checked the
spirit of gaiety in its "night life." There had been a
successful attack upon the British that day, and the "victory"
over the hated English was upon everyone's lips.</p>

<p>For another hour we wandered, noting the merriment
and confidence in conquest on every hand.</p>

<p>"Truly," declared Rasputin, "these Germans spread
reports of their own distress for propaganda purposes.
Ah, they are indeed a great people, with a great leader!"</p>

<p>I differed from him, for I have never had a liking
for Germans. At heart Rasputin had, I knew, no great
liking either. He admired them and assisted them because
he was a born adventurer, and as the tool of the
Kaiser was well paid for his services, while at the same
time he had succeeded in placing himself in the position
of autocrat over the Tsar himself.</p>

<p>After an expensive supper at a small place near the
Rosenthal Thor, where two scantily-clad girls danced
while the patrons ate, we retraced our steps to the
Neustadische-strasse.</p>

<p>On re-entering the hotel the hall-porter gave me a
message asking me to ring up Herr Weghinger at No.
2862, Potsdam.</p>

<p>This I did from our sitting-room, asking for Herr
Weghinger.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the voice. "Are you Herr Koster?"</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative, recognising the voice of
Baron von Hausen, who said:</p>

<p>"Will you please tell your friend that I have arranged
for your visit here, and that you will be welcomed. Be
outside the French Embassy at three o'clock, when a
yellow car will drive up. Enter it, and you will be
brought here. I shall await you." And then he wished
me good night.</p>

<p>The wire over which I had spoken was, I knew, one
of the private ones to the Neues Palais at Potsdam.</p>

<p>Rasputin had again triumphed. When I told him he
laughed coarsely, remarking:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
"People are too apt to regard this Kaiser fellow as
lord of the world. He will never work his will upon
Gregory. Nicholas tried, and failed. Let William try,
and he will discover that at least one man is his equal&mdash;and
more!"</p>

<p>On the following day at three o'clock we both stood
upon the kerb in the Pariser Platz, opposite the closed
French Embassy, when suddenly from the Sommerstrasse
a big yellow car approached us and drew up.
The driver, who had evidently been given our descriptions,
got down, saluted, and opened the door for us.
Then a minute later we were on our way out of Berlin
on the Potsdam road. The papers that day had reported
that the Emperor was in Brussels, but such misleading
statements are permissible in war.</p>

<p>When we had come down the hill to the Havel and
passed over the Glienicke Bridge, we sped through the
pleasant town of Potsdam, until at last we entered the
great Sanssouci Park, driving past the fountains straight
up the tree-lined Hauptweg till we pulled up before the
private door of the palace, that used by the Imperial
family.</p>

<p>The baron, in uniform and all smiles, was there to
meet us, as he had promised.</p>

<p>"I had a difficulty with the Emperor," he whispered
to me. "But as the Father insists, His Majesty has
given way."</p>

<p>Rasputin overheard his words, and I saw upon his
bearded lips a sinister smile.</p>

<p>Through rooms with painted ceilings we were conducted,
through the Shell Salon&mdash;the walls of which were
inlaid with shells, the friezes being of minerals and precious
stones&mdash;across the Marble Room, and then along an
endless, thickly carpeted corridor, which reminded me of
one at Peterhof leading to the Empress's private apartments,
until the baron saluted a sentry, passed him, and
a little farther on knocked discreetly at a polished
mahogany door, that of the Kaiser's private workroom.</p>

<p>A moment later we were ushered into a rather small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
room, plainly furnished, very much like an office. In a
chair by the fire sat the grey-bearded Chancellor smoking
a cigar, and standing with his back to the English grate
was the Emperor William, looking grey and worn, dressed
in a drab suit of tweeds.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gregory!" exclaimed His Majesty, who took no
notice of my unimportant self, "I do not forget our last
meeting. Well, you have done well&mdash;excellent work for
our Fatherland!" And he introduced the monk to the
Imperial Chancellor, who, I thought, greeted the charlatan
somewhat contemptuously.</p>

<p>Now, Rasputin, wearing clothes to which he was unaccustomed,
and devoid of his gold chain and jewelled
cross, which he had so constantly fingered when he granted
audiences to those who wished to bask in his smiles&mdash;which,
of course, always meant great pecuniary advantage
or official advancement&mdash;seemed at the first moment ill
at ease.</p>

<p>"I have done the bidding of my Imperial sister,"
was his reply. "I have for thee letters from her, also
letters for thy wife," and from the pocket of his clerical
coat he drew four letters, rather crumpled.</p>

<p>The Emperor hastily scanned the two which Alexandra
Feodorovna had addressed to himself, and I noticed a
smile of satisfaction flit across his grey, mobile features.</p>

<p>Then, placing them upon his littered writing-table,
he gave us seats, and around the fire we sat to talk.</p>

<p>Truly, that council of treachery was an historic one,
and cost the lives of many innocent non-combatant women
and children.</p>

<p>The Kaiser began by chaffing Rasputin as to his disguise,
saying with a laugh:</p>

<p>"Really, you might pass unsuspected anywhere,
Father! The baron has been telling me that you are at
this moment the very reverend Pastor van Meuwen, from
Utrecht. My police have no knowledge that you are
Russian and an enemy. But there, you are clever, and
your services to me are worthy far greater reward than
you have yet received. Now tell me," he added, "how is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
St&uuml;rmer? I sometimes wonder whether he is acting
straight or crooked. Only the other day he telegraphed
to Downing Street that you Russians would never agree
to a separate peace to isolate Britain. This is most
annoying."</p>

<p>"Thou art misled, as is all the world," replied the
monk with a meaning smile. "That telegram was sent to
London only after many conferences, in which Alexandra
Feodorovna took part with Nicholas, St&uuml;rmer, Fredericks,
and Protopopoff. The British Press was growing dubious
as to our determination in winning the war, hence
St&uuml;rmer's assurance to bamboozle the world was highly
necessary."</p>

<p>"That relieves us of much anxiety," remarked Bethmann-Hollweg,
chewing the end of his cigar. "We were
beginning to fear that St&uuml;rmer might be leaning towards
England."</p>

<p>Rasputin made a gesture in the negative.</p>

<p>"St&uuml;rmer is ever a good friend of the Fatherland,"
was his slow reply, his eyes fixed upon the Emperor.</p>

<p>"There must be famine in Russia," declared the
Kaiser impatiently. "Your friend Protopopoff has not
yet created it, as he promised when he saw me. Famine
will bring Russia quickly to her knees, as it will eventually
bring Britain. Our U-boats are doing marvels.
Happily we warned the British, therefore we are contravening
no convention."</p>

<p>"Soon our friends in London who have sworn never
to sheathe the sword until we are wiped from the face of
the earth will begin to squeal," remarked the Imperial
Chancellor with a laugh. "And especially if we can carry
out Professor Hoheisel's plan and create a pestilence. It
must be tried in Russia first, and then in England," Bethmann-Hollweg
went on. "The bacteria of anthrax,
glanders, and bubonic plague must be sown in various
parts of Russia, Gregory. Before you leave Berlin the
plan will be explained to you."</p>

<p>"The plan by which we sought to propagate cholera
by sending infected fruit to various charitable institutions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
broke down because the delivery of the fruit was delayed,
and it arrived at its destination in an uneatable condition,"
replied Rasputin. "No one would touch it, hence all our
plans were upset."</p>

<p>"The distribution of presents to charitable institutions
must be repeated," declared the Chancellor, to which the
Emperor agreed. "To-morrow you will be told our
wishes in that direction," the Chancellor went on.</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed the Emperor, "this military offensive
must stop, and at once, if we are successfully to invade
England. As soon as Russia makes peace our hands
will be free to strike a staggering blow at John Bull.
Not till then."</p>

<p>"As soon as we bring Russia to her senses then we
shall begin to twist the tail of the British lion," said the
Chancellor. "All our plans are complete. As soon as
there is quiet on the Russian front we can, within forty-eight
hours, if we wish, put six army corps into East
Anglia between the Tyne and the Blackwater," he added
boastfully.</p>

<p>"Hindenburg will lead them into London one day,
never fear," declared the Emperor in the most earnest
confidence.</p>

<p>I sat in silence, listening to this strange talk of what
was to happen to England when Russia was crushed.</p>

<p>"The charges against Soukhomlinoff ought never to
have been made," the Emperor went on, addressing the
monk. "I understood from your report to Steinhauer
that you were arranging that the Tsar should hush up
the inquiry?"</p>

<p>"The Emperor gave orders to that effect, in consequence
of the advice of the Empress, but the charges
were so very grave that St&uuml;rmer urged him to cancel
his orders lest the public should suspect him of any
intention of suppressing a scandal."</p>

<p>It was true that the charges against the Minister of
War were astounding. A high official in the Ministry,
named Kartzoff, had betrayed his chief, whereupon Colonel
Tugen Baranovsky, late Chief of the Mobilisation Depart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>ment
of the Russian General Staff, had declared that the
mobilisation plans drafted by the general were full of
wilful errors, while rifles, machine-guns, and field and
heavy guns were all lacking. Allegations had been made
by General Petrovsky, later Chief of the Fortifications
Department, to the effect that the general had only twice
visited the artillery administration during the whole time
he held his portfolio as Minister, while Colonel Balvinkine,
one of the heads of the Artillery Administration, had
asserted that Soukhomlinoff had insisted upon important
contracts for machine-guns being given to the Rickerts
factory at a cost of two thousand roubles each, while the
Toula factory could turn out excellent machine-guns at
nine hundred roubles.</p>

<p>Such were the charges whispered loudly from end to
end of Russia.</p>

<p>"It would be best for that fellow Kartzoff to disappear,"
declared the Kaiser. "His mouth should be
closed, as he may become an awkward witness. Tell
Protopopoff from me that it would be judicious to send
him to some unknown destination, and that I shall expect
to hear early news that he is missing."</p>

<p>"I will carry out thine order," said Rasputin gravely.
"I agree with thee that Kartzoff is highly dangerous.
Besides, he is a friend of my worst enemy, Purishkevitch,
the member of the Duma who has been agitating
against the events at the front."</p>

<p>Rasputin, by the way, did not fail to give Protopopoff
the Kaiser's message, and three days after our return to
Petrograd Kartzoff was enticed away from there by means
of a forged telegram, a week later his body being found in
a wood near Kislovodsk, in the North Caucasus, while two
other witnesses against the Minister of War were arrested,
and died later in the island fortress of Schl&uuml;sselburg.</p>

<p>The Kaiser seemed unusually cordial towards the
monk, much more so than on the occasion when they
met in Silesia. The Chancellor seemed to be watching
the "holy" man, taking note of his every gesture and
every remark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
The Kaiser agreed entirely with his Chancellor's
views, and was insistent upon the creation of a pestilence
in Russia.</p>

<p>"Cholera or plague could work more for our ends in
Russia in a month than we can effect by military force
in a whole year," he declared as he lit a cigarette, afterwards
tossing the match carelessly into the fire. "What
are the views of Alexandra Feodorovna?"</p>

<p>"The same as thine own," the monk replied. "Unfortunately
all our efforts failed. A man named
Tsourikoff by some means obtained knowledge of what
was intended. Her Majesty heard of it, hence I had
him removed two days later. He was met by a certain
dancer, and had supper with her at Pivato's, in the
Morskaya. An hour after they parted Tsourikoff died
mysteriously."</p>

<p>"The dancer was a friend of yours, eh? Perhaps a
sister-disciple?" remarked the Emperor with a meaning
grin.</p>

<p>"Thou hast guessed aright," answered the monk.
"But after that we did not dare to carry the infection
further."</p>

<p>"It must be done. I have some ideas. The baron
will explain them to you to-morrow, and I shall expect
you to carry them out," said the great War Lord. "In
Russia there must be revolt and disease, in England
invasion, and in France&mdash;well, we know how we shall
conquer both France and Italy," he added, smiling mysteriously.</p>

<p>He spoke as one who believed that he held the destinies
of Europe in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>"Middle Europe will conquer the world, of that I
have no doubt. All is in God's hands," agreed the
"saint" in bad German, crossing himself with a mock
piety which seemed to amuse both the Emperor and his
Chancellor.</p>

<p>"Listen to-morrow to Hoheisel's scheme, which I have
approved," said the Emperor, passing to his visitor another
cigarette from the heavy golden box. "The pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>fessor
will call on you with the baron and explain. Act
boldly, dear friend Gregory, for recollect that you have
behind you the whole resources of Prussia and the good
will of myself."</p>

<p>The monk, who had only on the previous day declared
that he would subject the Kaiser to his influence, had
fallen so completely beneath the thrall of the German
Emperor's curious hypnotism that he sat ready and eager
to do his bidding.</p>

<p>"The letters you have brought to me from Tsarskoe-Selo
are satisfactory so far as they go, but there is
still much to be done," said the Kaiser. "Tell the Empress
that I will reply to her by courier, but that she
is to continue her efforts, and that you both have my
full and complete support. The prosecution of Soukhomlinoff
must be at once suppressed, and those hostile statements
in the Duma from time to time directed against
us must be made a penal offence punishable by deportation.
Kartzoff must go, and Purishkevitch, who is so
constantly speaking in the Duma against yourself and
others, should be suppressed without delay. Perhaps he
will come to a sudden end!" suggested the Emperor.
"At least we can hope so."</p>

<p>Next day at noon the baron brought to us a short,
stout, yellow-haired man in gold spectacles, the famous
German bacteriologist, Professor Hoheisel, of the
Friedrichshain Hospital.</p>

<p>With the door locked, we all four sat down while the
deep-voiced scientist unfolded his plan for the devastating
of certain populous areas in Russia by the dissemination
of a newly discovered and highly infectious disease.</p>

<p>"The disease was discovered a year ago by Gerhold,
at the Alt-Moabit, and is closely allied to bubonic plague.
It is more highly infectious than anthrax or smallpox,
and inevitably proves fatal," the professor said, seated
at the head of the small table. "Curiously enough, infants
seem to be immune up to six years of age. Now,
my proposal, to which both the Emperor and the Chancellor
have agreed, is that the cultures which I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
prepared, and of which a large quantity is already in
Stockholm ready to be utilised, should be introduced into
a consignment of meat extract and tinned beef which
has come from South America, and which is being
held back by a certain firm in Stockholm friendly
to ourselves."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to infect it?" asked the monk,
the devilish plot appealing at once to his cunning and
unscrupulous mind.</p>

<p>"By puncturing the tins and introducing the culture
by means of a hypodermic syringe, and closing up the
hole with a spot of solder. The bottles will be treated by
puncturing the corks with the needle and closing the hole
with melted resin."</p>

<p>"I might say," added the baron, "that the cargo has
been purchased by our friends, Messrs. Juel and Ehrensvard,
who are awaiting instructions before re-shipping it.
When the meat is prepared it will be your work, Father,
to see that it is distributed in the two cities in which
we want to experiment, namely, Nijni-Novgorod and
Vologda."</p>

<p>"They are doomed cities, eh?" I remarked.</p>

<p>"We intend them to be so," the professor said.
"When once the disease is released it will spread everywhere,
and no precautions can be taken because, up to
the present, it is known to only half-a-dozen of us in
Berlin, and we have no knowledge how to treat it successfully."</p>

<p>Rasputin was silent.</p>

<p>"It will certainly be far more dangerous than cholera
or plague&mdash;dangerous to ourselves, I mean," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Of course the epidemic must not be allowed to break
out in Petrograd or in any of the army centres&mdash;at least,
not at present. We must first watch the effect in Vologda
and Nijni."</p>

<p>"Well," said the monk, "what do you wish me
to do?"</p>

<p>"You are returning by way of Stockholm," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>
the baron. "His Majesty wishes the professor to accompany
you, and in the warehouse of the firm I have named
you will see the canned goods and bottles. The professor
will show you that the tins have been repainted and
are labelled with the mark of a well-known firm, so that
there can be no suspicion of them. Only the paint is
a much brighter blue than that usually employed. The
reason of this is that they can easily be identified by
any in the secret, and prevented from being opened in
any area save those two towns I have named."</p>

<p>"When do you leave?" asked the deep-voiced demon
in human form.</p>

<p>"On Friday next. I have still a number of persons
to see."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be ready to travel with you, Father,"
declared the professor; and then, after taking some
brandy and soda-water, the conference ended.</p>

<p>The devilish ingenuity of the whole scheme appalled
me. The sowing of cholera germs by means of infected
fruit had happily failed, but now Germany intended to
strike a blow at the civil population of Russia upon a
scale more gigantic than I had ever imagined.</p>

<p>Next day, a man who gave the name of Emil D&ouml;llen
brought Rasputin a letter, which I opened.</p>

<p>It was, I found, a code message which had been
received at the great German wireless station at Nauen,
having been dispatched from Petrograd, ostensibly to the
warship <i>Petropavlovsk</i> in the Baltic, as Rasputin had
arranged before he left Russia.</p>

<p>When I decoded it, I found it to be from the Minister
Protopopoff, containing certain further instructions, as
well as a message from the Tsaritza&mdash;which necessitated
the monk having a second audience with the
Kaiser.</p>

<p>In reply&mdash;while the secret messenger D&ouml;llen retired
for an hour&mdash;I sat down and wrote, at the monk's
dictation, a long dispatch, in which he made brief allusion
as to the proposed dissemination of disease, and stating
his intention to remain some days in Stockholm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All is well," he dictated. "The Emperor William
sends his best greetings and acknowledgments of your
dispatch of the 3rd inst. It has been found necessary to
recall the troops who have been held ready at Hamburg and
Bremen for the invasion of Britain. The German General
Staff have, after due consideration, decided that an invasion
before Russia is crushed might meet with disaster, hence they
are turning their attention to submarine and aerial attacks
upon Britain in order to crush her. I have learnt from a
conversation with the Kaiser that London is to be destroyed
by a succession of fleets of super-aeroplanes launching
newly devised explosive and poison-gas bombs of a terribly
destructive character. Urge S. [St&uuml;rmer] to disclaim at once
all knowledge of the Rickert contracts. The action taken
against General S. is again ordered to be dropped. See the
Emperor and persuade him. Blessings upon you.</p>
<p class="fsc">"Gregory."&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p></div>

<p>Then I proceeded to put it into the special code which
Rasputin and Protopopoff alone used, and when D&ouml;llen
called it was ready for transmission from Nauen back
to the Russian battleship, to which I had addressed it, to
be "picked up" by the wireless station in Petrograd.</p>

<p>The "holy Father" greatly enjoyed himself in a quiet
way in Berlin. Indeed, he purchased a ready-made suit
of clothes, and, attired in them, he went out on two
occasions and did not return till dawn, and then half
intoxicated. On the second occasion the baron called
and remonstrated with him, pointing out that he was
running great risk.</p>

<p>"We have been watching you in order to avoid any
unwelcome inquiries by the police. But if you continue
we can accept no further responsibility," he said. "You
see, you pose as Dutch without being able to speak a
word of the language!"</p>

<p>After that Rasputin became more discreet, but I
was nevertheless glad when one night we met Professor
Hoheisel at the station and left for Hamburg, duly
arriving at Stockholm two days later, where we lost no
time in visiting the premises of Juel and Ehrensvard.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Juel, the head of the Hun firm which
was doing a large export business between Sweden and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
Germany, called upon us at the Grand Hotel within an
hour of our arrival, and together we all went to a
narrow street off the Fjellgatan, not far from the Saltsj&ouml;banans
station, where we found a great warehouse
filled to overflowing with tins of corned beef and cases
containing bottles of beef extract, which had come from
America, destined for Germany, but which had been
held up to be diverted to Russia after being treated
with disease germs.</p>

<p>We were shown stacks upon stacks of tins of one
pound, two pounds and six pounds of beef, all bearing
a well-known label, but all painted a peculiar blue for
identification purposes. In the store we were met by
four German laboratory assistants of the fat professor,
ready to commence work upon the tins.</p>

<p>"I will show you what we shall do," said Hoheisel.
"The manipulation of the tins is quite easy."</p>

<p>He conducted us to a small room on the top floor,
which I at once saw was fitted as a laboratory, and
which contained microscopes, incubators, stands of test-tubes,
and all the other apparatus appertaining to the
bacteriologist.</p>

<p>One of his assistants had carried up four small tins
of beef, with a couple of bottles of beef extract. These
he placed on the table, and as we stood around he took
a small bradawl, and having punctured the tin at the
large end close to the rim, he took from one of the
incubators a test-tube full of a cloudy brown liquid
gelatine. Then filling a hypodermic syringe&mdash;upon which
was an extra long needle&mdash;he thrust it into the contents
of the tin and injected the virus into the meat.</p>

<p>Afterwards, with a small soldering-iron he closed
the puncture.</p>

<p>"That tin, infected as it is, is sufficient to cause
an epidemic which might result in thousands of deaths,"
declared the Hun professor proudly.</p>

<p>His assistant then took a bottle of beef extract, which
in Russia is popular with all classes in preparing their
cabbage soup, and refilling the syringe, plunged the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
needle through the cork, afterwards placing a spot of
melted resin upon the puncture.</p>

<p>"You see how simple it is!" laughed the professor,
addressing the "saint." "All that now remains is for a
firm in Petrograd to buy the consignment and arrange
for it to be sold to wholesale dealers in Vologda and
Nijni. This we expect you to arrange."</p>

<p>"I certainly will," replied Rasputin promptly. "Truly,
the idea is a most ingenious one&mdash;a disease which is
as yet unknown!"</p>

<p>We remained in Stockholm for four days longer.
The professor and his assistants were working strenuously,
we knew, preparing death for the population of those
two Russian towns.</p>

<p>One afternoon, after he had lunched with us at the
hotel, he said:</p>

<p>"If our experiment is successful, then we mean to
repeat it from South America to England. It is therefore
most important that news of the epidemic does not
reach the ears of the Allies. You will point out that to
the Minister Protopopoff. When the plague breaks out
the censorship must be of the strictest."</p>

<p>Rasputin nodded. He quite understood. He hated
the British just as heartily as did the Tsaritza.</p>

<p>A week later we were back at Tsarskoe-Selo, and
the monk&mdash;who pretended to have been on a pilgrimage
to Our Lady of Tver&mdash;made to the Empress a full report
of his journey to Potsdam. He also told her of the
diabolical plot to sweep off the population of Vologda
and Nijni as an experiment, in order to see how Hun
"science" could win the war.</p>

<p>Protopopoff came to Rasputin's house half-a-dozen
times within the next three days, and it was arranged
that a firm of importers, Illine and Stroukoff, of Petrograd,
should handle the consignment of preserved meat.
Both partners in the firm were in the pay of the Ministry
of the Interior, hence it was not difficult to arrange that
the whole cargo should be sent to Vologda and Nijni to
relieve there the growing shortage of meat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>
I strove to combat the clever plot, but was, alas!
unable to do so. Every precaution was taken against
possible failure. The cargo arrived, and was at once
sent on by rail to its destination, payment being made for
it through ordinary channels, and nobody suspecting. Food
was welcomed indeed in Russia in those days of 1916.</p>

<p>In the stress of exciting events that followed I forgot
the affair for several weeks. One night, however, Rasputin,
on returning from Peterhof, where the Court was
at that moment, received Protopopoff, and the pair sat
down to drink together.</p>

<p>Suddenly His Excellency exclaimed, with a laugh:</p>

<p>"Your mission to Berlin has borne fruit, my dear
Gregory! For the past four days I have been receiving
terrible reports from Vologda, and worse from Nijni-Novgorod.
The inhabitants have been seized by a
mysterious and terribly fatal disease. A medical commission
left Petrograd yesterday to study it."</p>

<p>"Let them study it!" laughed Rasputin. "They will
discover no mode of treatment."</p>

<p>"Both towns are rapidly becoming decimated. There
have been over thirty thousand deaths, and the mortality
is daily increasing."</p>

<p>"As I expected," remarked the monk. "The professor
knows what he is doing. Later on we shall be
sending the infection into England and cause our John
Bull friends a surprise."</p>

<p>"But the position is terribly serious," said His
Excellency.</p>

<p>"No doubt. Berlin is watching the result. One day
they may deem it wise to infect our army. But that
must be left to their discretion."</p>

<p>Truly the result of that devilish plot was most awful.
In the three months that followed&mdash;though not a word
leaked out to the Allies, so careful were Protopopoff and
the camarilla to suppress all the facts&mdash;more than half
the population of the two cities died from a disease
which to this day is a complete mystery, and its bacilli
known only to German bacteriologists.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">the "perfume of death"</span></h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">I am</span> much grieved to hear of the disaster at Obukhov.
The accident to Colonel Zinovief is most deplorable. Please
place a wreath upon his grave from me. Pray always for
us.</p>
<p class="fsc">"Alix."&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p></div>

<p>This was the text of a telegram addressed to Rasputin
from the Empress, which I opened when it
was placed in my hands. It had been sent from
Bakhtchisaray, the Oriental town in the Crimea, where
Alexandra Feodorovna had gone to visit the military
hospitals, it being necessary for her to pose before
Russia as sympathetic to the wounded.</p>

<p>The disaster to which she referred had taken place
at the great steel works at Obukhov, the outrage having
been committed by two German secret agents named
Lachkarioff and Filimonoff, who had visited Rasputin and
from whose hand they had received German money.
Nearly five hundred lives had been lost, as the foundry
had been in close proximity to an explosives factory,
where Colonel Zinovief, the director, had been blown
to atoms.</p>

<p>It was late at night, and the monk, who was in a
state of semi-intoxication, on hearing of the wish of
Her Majesty, remarked:</p>

<p>"Ah! a clever woman, F&eacute;odor&mdash;very clever. She
never misses an opportunity to show her sympathy with
the people. Oh! yes&mdash;order the wreath to-morrow from
Solovioff in the Nevski&mdash;a fine large one." Then
laughing, he added: "The people, when they see it, will
never suspect that Alexandra Feodorovna knew of the
pending disaster eight days ago. But," he added suddenly,
after a pause, "is it not time, F&eacute;odor, that I
saw another vision?"</p>

<p>I laughed. I knew how, during the week that had
elapsed since our return from the secret visit to Potsdam,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
he was constantly holding reunions of his sister-disciples,
many fresh "converts" being admitted to the new
religion.</p>

<p>Both Lachkarioff and Filimonoff, authors of the
terrible disaster at Obukhov, had been furnished with
passports by Protopopoff, and were already well on their
way to Sweden, but the catastrophe was the signal for
a terrible period of unrest throughout Russia, and in
the fortnight that followed, rumours, purposely started by
German agents and the secret police under Protopopoff,
assumed most alarming proportions.</p>

<p>All was the creation of Rasputin's evil brain. With
the Emperor and Empress absent in the South, he had,
with the connivance of "No. 70, Berlin," determined to
undermine the moral of the whole nation by disseminating
false reports and arranging for disaster after
disaster.</p>

<p>In the "saint's" study in the Gorokhovaya there
was arranged the terrible railway "accident" which
occurred near Smolensk, in which a crowded troop train
collided with an ambulance train, the wreckage being
run into by a second troop train, all three trains eventually
taking fire and burning. The exact loss of life will
never be known.</p>

<p>Another outrage was the destruction of the big railway
bridge over the River Tvertza, not far from Kava,
thus blocking the Petrograd-Moscow line, while a train
conveying high explosives made in England a few days
later blew up while passing the station of Odozerskaja,
completely wrecking the line between Archangel and
Petrograd and killing nearly three hundred people.</p>

<p>Each of these outrages was arranged in my presence,
and I was compelled to assist in counting the money
which was afterwards given by the monk to their perpetrators
as price of their perfidy.</p>

<p>"We must create unrest," Rasputin declared one
night to His Excellency the Minister Protopopoff, as the
precious pair sat together. "We must prepare Russia
for disaster."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
Hence it was that they arranged for a series of most
alarming false rumours to be circulated throughout the
length and breadth of the Empire.</p>

<p>Indeed, on the day following, I heard in a bank
where I had business that all Moscow was involved in
a great revolution, that the Moscow police were on strike,
and that the troops had refused to fire upon the populace.
Everyone stood aghast at the news. But the truth was
that the telegraphs and telephones between Moscow and
Petrograd had been wilfully cut in three places by agents
of Protopopoff, and while those alarming rumours were
current in Petrograd, similar rumours were rife in Moscow
that revolution had broken out in the capital.</p>

<p>Rasputin and his friends in the course of a few days
created a veritable whirlwind of false reports, hoping
by that means to shatter or stifle all manifestations
of patriotic feeling, and prepare Russia for a separate
peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had contrived, as the Kaiser ordered,
to prevent the offensive being resumed in Poland; and
yet so cleverly did he effect all this that General Brusiloff,
who was at the south-west front, actually gave
an interview to a British journalist, declaring that the
war was already won, "though it was merely speculation
to estimate how much longer will be required before
the enemy are convinced that the cause for the sake
of which they have drenched Europe in blood is irretrievably
lost."</p>

<p>The cold white light of later events has indeed revealed
the black hearts of Rasputin and his friends, for
while all this was in progress St&uuml;rmer, though so active
in the betrayal of his country, boldly made a speech
deploring the fact that anyone credited the sinister
rumours which his fellow-conspirators had started, and
to save his face he warned the working-classes to remain
patient and prosecute the war with vigour.</p>

<p>I recollect well the day he had made that speech&mdash;the
day on which the Labour group of the Central War
Industrial Committee issued its declaration. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
a reunion of the sister-disciples, at which three new
members were admitted to the cult, all society women
under thirty, and all good-looking. Their names were
Baroness T&eacute;r&eacute;nine, whose husband had been Governor
of Yaroslav; Countess Chidlovski, one of the acknowledged
society beauties of Petrograd, who had of late
had an "affair" with an Italian tenor named Baccelli;
and Anna, the pretty young daughter of a woman named
Friede, who was also a "disciple."</p>

<p>There was a large attendance, and Rasputin exhibited
more than the usual mock piety. In his jumbled jargon,
which he called a sermon&mdash;that mixture of quotations
from the "Lives of Saints" mingled with horrible obscenities&mdash;he
had referred to the terrible rumours.</p>

<p>"These, I fear, my dear sisters, are, alas! too true,"
he declared. "Being in the position of knowing much,
I beg of you all to pray ceaselessly, and let these three
who to-day join our holy circle take upon themselves
the duty of obtaining fresh converts, and thus ensure
to themselves the blessing of him who stands here before
you&mdash;the saviour of Russia."</p>

<p>Then he paused, and all the kneeling women crossed
themselves, piously murmuring, as was part of the creed:</p>

<p>"God's will be done! God's will be done! Truly,
our Father Gregory is holy! Truly, the sacrifice which
each and all of us make is made to God!"</p>

<p>The three newly-admitted aspirants, dressed in very
flimsy black in the mode which the monk imposed upon
them, knelt before the Father and kissed his hands,
while from his lips fell those awful blasphemies, which,
amazing as it was, hypnotised, neurotic society women
believed to be the truth.</p>

<p>Afterwards Rasputin gave them all tea and cake, he
being personally waited upon by the three neophytes.
Then, half-an-hour after the last one had departed&mdash;for
the three had remained behind with him for further
private instruction and conversation, as was usual&mdash;the
Prime Minister St&uuml;rmer was announced.</p>

<p>"I have made the speech you suggested," he declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
to the monk as he sank into a chair. "Phew! what
a smell of perfume, my dear Gregory!" he laughed.
"Your sister-disciples have left it behind them. Open
the window, F&eacute;odor," he exclaimed, turning to me. "Let
us have some fresh air."</p>

<p>The monk then explained that while St&uuml;rmer had
made that public declaration he had told the women that
the situation was grave, well knowing that they, in turn,
would tell their husbands, and the rumours would quickly
be propagated.</p>

<p>"I have had another reassuring telegram from
Downing Street," St&uuml;rmer remarked, with a grin. "I
dare not publish it, otherwise it would upset our friends
in Berlin."</p>

<p>"As I have told you, the Kaiser forbids the publication
of any of our reassurances from France or
England&mdash;especially from the English, whom he hates
so deeply. What, I wonder, will be the fate of the
English when he is able to send an army of invasion
across the North Sea?"</p>

<p>"If he is ever able. I doubt it," remarked the
traitorous Premier of Russia.</p>

<p>"He certainly intends doing so," said Rasputin.
"And when he does I should be sorry to be in Britain.
They will treat the civilians worse than they did the
Belgians."</p>

<p>"Yes; he intended being in Paris two years ago,"
replied the goat-bearded <i>d&eacute;bauch&eacute;</i> in uniform.</p>

<p>"It is time I saw another vision," said the monk
presently. "I shall see one to-night most probably&mdash;one
concerning our defeat."</p>

<p>"Do," urged St&uuml;rmer. "You have not had a vision
for quite a long time. It impresses all classes, and we
can make so much use of it when dealing with Nicholas.
He believes as thoroughly in your visions as in the
spirit-voice of the dead Alexander."</p>

<p>Next day the whole world of Petrograd was
startled.</p>

<p>To Grichka the Blessed Virgin had once again re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>vealed
herself, just as she had done years ago to the
peasant girl at Lourdes.</p>

<p>The Procurator of the Holy Synod called to see him
at noon to inquire of him personally, and ascertain what
he had seen. Rasputin, with his hands crossed over his
breast, turned his dark eyes heavenward, and said:</p>

<p>"It is true that last night, just after midnight, as
I was praying in my room, Our Lady appeared unto
me in a cloud of shining light. She was clothed in
bright blue, and in her hands she bore a bunch of lilies.
Behind her I saw a picture of a great battlefield, where
our soldiers were retreating in disorder, being shot down
in hundreds by the machine-guns of the enemy&mdash;and
worse&mdash;and worse!" And the charlatan hid his face
in his hands as though to shut out the horror of the
recollection.</p>

<p>"What else?" asked the head of the Russian Church.
"Tell me, O Father."</p>

<p>"It is too terrible&mdash;the public must not know&mdash;&mdash;"
he gasped, as though in fear. "I saw our Emperor killed
on the field of battle; he was struck in the head by a
piece of shell from one of the German long-range guns,
and half his face was blown away. Ugh!" And he
shuddered. "The sight of it was terrible. My blood
ran cold. Nicholas, our Emperor, dead! I saw Brusiloff,
too, lying shot, with a dozen other generals. Then
the scene changed, and I saw the burial of the Emperor
with all pomp, and his widow Alexandra Feodorovna
following the coffin."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then Our Lady opened her lips, and I heard her
voice," went on the "holy" liar. "She spake to me
slowly and solemnly, saying: 'O Gregory, what thou
hast witnessed is decreed to take place within forty
days from to-day! These scenes will be enacted upon
Russian soil&mdash;and worse. The people of Petrograd,
Moscow and Warsaw will be put to the sword by the
enemy, who have right and justice upon their side.
Russia has fallen away from God, and is now accursed.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
I shrieked at those fateful words. But she repeated
them, adding: 'Thou, O Gregory, canst still save Russia
if thou wilt raise thy voice in warning. Peace must be
effected. Let those who are in alliance with Russia fight
on if they will, but let Russia remain holy for the sake
of its innocent people and its great Imperial house.
Warn His Majesty at once, warn his Ministers, to cut
themselves adrift from those nations which are seeking
to profit by their alliance with Russia. Compel them
to make peace with the Emperor William. If this is
not concluded within forty days, then God's wrath will
fall upon this land. Thou art sent by God as His
apostle, therefore take heed and take instant action!'
And a second later she had faded out, and there was
nothing but darkness."</p>

<p>I could see how greatly our visitor was impressed.</p>

<p>"The Emperor should surely know," he said, astounded.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we must not alarm the public too greatly,"
Rasputin replied.</p>

<p>"Already it is on everyone's lips," exclaimed the
other. "The wildest stories are afloat concerning the
Blessed Virgin's appearance to you. We certainly must
have peace with Germany. That is what everyone is
saying, except members of the Duma and the war
party."</p>

<p>Thus, by pretending to have seen a vision at an
hour when, truth to tell, he had been snoring in a
drunken sleep, half Russia grew alarmed, including the
Emperor and Empress, who both hurried back to Tsarskoe-Selo,
where Rasputin repeated with much embellishment
what he had told the Procurator of the Holy
Synod.</p>

<p>Just at the moment Rasputin was engaged upon a
piece of outrageous blackmailing, which I think ought
to be recorded against him.</p>

<p>The facts were briefly as follow. The German agent
Lachkarioff, who with his accomplice had blown up the
Obukhov steel works and was now safe in Sweden, had,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
while in Petrograd, made the acquaintance of a certain
Madame Doukhovski, the young wife of the President
of the Superior Tribunal at Kharkof. She was a giddy
little woman, and the monk had plotted with old Countess
Ignatieff to entice her to join the cult, but she had
always refused. Lachkarioff was a good-looking, well-dressed
man, who posed as a commercial magnate of
Riga, and she, I suppose, fell beneath his charm. At
any rate, for a long time the pair were inseparable.</p>

<p>One day the German agent, who was an exceedingly
wily person, came to Rasputin and told him that he
had induced the young lady of Kharkof to reveal to
him certain secrets concerning the dealings of Soukhomlinoff
and the supply of machine-guns for the Army&mdash;facts
which had been presented in strictest confidence by
one of the War Minister's enemies to the President of
the Kharkof tribunal.</p>

<p>Rasputin smiled in triumph when he heard the exact
details which Madame Doukhovski had divulged.</p>

<p>"Sit down yonder, my friend, and put that into
writing, and sign it," said the monk, indicating the
table by the window.</p>

<p>"You will not punish her for her indiscretion, I hope,"
remarked the man, who was at the moment plotting that
series of terrible disasters.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Rasputin assured him. "Your
friend is my friend. But when such statements are
made I like to have them on record. If Soukhomlinoff
comes up for trial&mdash;which I very much doubt&mdash;then the
memorandum may be of use to prove what silly and
baseless gossip has been in circulation."</p>

<p>In consequence of this assurance, Lachkarioff wrote
down what had been told him by the judge's wife, a
document which the "saint" preserved with much care&mdash;until
the Obukhov catastrophe had taken place and its
author was out of Russia. Then he wrote to Madame
Doukhovski and asked her to call upon him upon an
urgent matter concerning her husband.</p>

<p>In surprise, and perhaps a little anxious, she kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
the appointment one afternoon, and I ushered her into
the monk's room.</p>

<p>He rose, and, addressing her roughly, said:</p>

<p>"So you have obeyed me, woman! And it is best
for you that you have done so. Hitherto you have
held me in contempt and refused all invitations to visit
me. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I am not a believer," was her open,
straightforward answer.</p>

<p>"Then you will believe me ere I have done," he
declared, with an evil grin, stroking his ragged beard,
and fixing his eyes upon her.</p>

<p>"You insult me," she cried angrily. "Why should
you speak to me like this?"</p>

<p>"Because you have been an associate of Felix Lachkarioff&mdash;a
traitor and a spy," he declared in that deep,
hard voice of his. "Oh! you cannot deny it. Your
husband has no knowledge that you were an intimate
friend of the man who has fled from Russia after
causing that frightful disaster at Obukhov. Is not
that so?"</p>

<p>The handsome, dark-haired woman whom the spy
had so grossly betrayed turned pale, and sat utterly
staggered that her secret was out. She had never
dreamed that the handsome, polite man who had one
day been presented to her in the lounge of the H&ocirc;tel
d'Europe was a German agent, that he was engaged in
committing outrages on behalf of the enemy, or that he
was friendly with the monk.</p>

<p>"Your husband does not know that spy? Answer
me?" demanded Rasputin roughly.</p>

<p>"I have told my husband nothing," was her faltering
reply.</p>

<p>"That is not surprising, Madame," laughed the
"saint," leaning back in the chair where he had seated
himself, "especially when you have told that spy certain
secrets of our Government, which you obtained by examining
the dossiers which have been passing through
your husband's hands."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
"What do you mean?" she cried, starting up in
indignation.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," he said; "it is useless to pretend ignorance,
Madame. Read this!"</p>

<p>And he handed her a copy of what the German agent
had written, saying: "I have the original, which I am
passing to the authorities, so that they may take what
action they deem best against you as a traitor and
against your husband for negligence!"</p>

<p>The unfortunate woman, when she scanned the statement,
went pale to the lips, fully realising the extreme
seriousness of the nature of her offence, now that her
admirer was known to be a spy of Germany.</p>

<p>"But you won't do that?" she gasped. "Think,
Father, what it would mean both to my husband and
myself! Think!" she cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>"You have revealed the contents of certain highly
confidential documents to the Germans," the monk said.
"You do not deny it. You, Madame Doukhovski, are
a traitor to Russia, and evidence of your treachery is
contained in that confession of a German spy whom
you assisted and whom you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I looked at the dossiers on my husband's table
because Monsieur Lachkarioff asked me to do so," she
declared. "He told me he was a friend of Soukhomlinoff,
and that he was doing all he could to assist in clearing
him of the charges levelled against him. I believed him,
alas!&mdash;I was foolish enough to believe that he spoke
the truth. And now he has betrayed me!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you were infatuated by the man," laughed
the monk scornfully. "If you were so weak, then you
must pay the penalty."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;what?" she asked breathlessly, and
pale as death.</p>

<p>"Exposure," replied the charlatan who was the head
of the traitorous camarilla around the throne. "Our
dear land is in serious peril to-day, therefore those
who attempt to betray her should be held up as examples
to others."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
"But you will not&mdash;you'll not let anyone know of
my indiscretion!" she begged.</p>

<p>"That certainly is my intention," was his hard reply.
"This statement was made to me by your lover, and
it is but right that it should be investigated, so that we
may know the extent of the harm that you have done."</p>

<p>The frantic, despairing woman, bursting into tears,
threw herself at the feet of the "miracle worker,"
begging hard for mercy.</p>

<p>"Think!" she cried. "Think what it will mean to
my husband and myself. He will probably be placed
under arrest and lose his post, while I&mdash;I would rather
die than face such exposure."</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear Madame," said Rasputin tauntingly.
"Life is very sweet, you know."</p>

<p>"But you must not do this!" she shrieked loudly.
"Promise me, Father, that you will not! Promise me&mdash;do!"</p>

<p>Rasputin drew his hand roughly from her, for she
had seized it as she implored him to show her mercy.</p>

<p>"There may be some extenuating circumstances in
your case&mdash;but I doubt it," he said.</p>

<p>"There are!" she declared. "I grew to love the
man. I was blind, mad, infatuated&mdash;but now I hate
him! Would that I could kill the man who wrought
such disaster in our land! Would that I could kill him
with my own hand!"</p>

<p>Rasputin drew a long breath. The wish she expressed
had suddenly aroused within his inventive brain
a means of executing a sharp and bitter revenge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps one day, ere long, you may be afforded
opportunity," he said in a changed voice. "If so, I will
call you here again and explain what I mean."</p>

<p>"Ah! Then I may hope for your pity and indulgence,
eh?" she cried quickly, but still in deep anxiety.</p>

<p>Yet Rasputin would not commit himself, for he was
playing a very deep and intricate game.</p>

<p>When the erring woman had gone the monk filled
his glass with brandy, some of that choice old cognac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
which the Empress sent him regularly, and turning to
me, said:</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor, the man Doukhovski is wealthy, I understand.
Protopopoff has been making inquiry, and finds
that he is owner of a large estate near Ryazhsk, and
that from an uncle quite recently he inherited nearly a
million roubles. He only retains his office because he
does not regard it as patriotic to retire while the war
is in progress. What will he think of his wife's betrayal
when he knows of it?"</p>

<p>"But you will not inform him," I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not if Madame is reasonable. She is wealthy in
her own right," replied the monk. "If women err they
must be compelled to pay the price," he went on in a
hard voice. "Felix Lachkarioff evidently deceived her
very cleverly. But there&mdash;he is one of the most expert
agents that the K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzerstrasse possesses, and is so
essentially a ladies' man."</p>

<p>After a pause Rasputin, lighting a cigarette, laughed
lightly to himself, and said:</p>

<p>"The report furnished to me yesterday shows that
Madame was one of the Plechkoffs of Lublin, and her
balance at the Azov Bank is a very considerable one.
The price of my silence is the money she has there.
And I shall obtain it, F&eacute;odor&mdash;you will see," he added
with confidence.</p>

<p>So ruthlessly did he treat the unfortunate woman
that, by dint of threats to place the original of that
statement of Lachkarioff before the Minister Protopopoff,
he had before a week had passed every rouble
she possessed.</p>

<p>I was present on the night when she came to him
to make the offer, the negotiations having been opened
and carried on by a man named Zouieff, one of the
several professional blackmailers whom Rasputin employed
from time to time under the guise of "lawyers."
She was beside herself in terror and despair, and carried
with her a cheque-book.</p>

<p>The interview was a strikingly dramatic one. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>
penitent, submissive, and full of hatred of the spy under
whose influence she had fallen; the monk cold, brutal,
and unforgiving.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said at last, when she offered him a
monetary consideration in exchange for his silence. "But
I am not content with a few paltry roubles. I am
collecting for my new monastery at Kertch, and what
you give will atone to God for your crime."</p>

<p>Within ten minutes she had written out a cheque for
the whole of her private fortune, while at the monk's
dictation I wrote out a declaration that his allegations
were false, a document which he signed and handed to
her, together with Lachkarioff's original statement.</p>

<p>Even then Rasputin's cunning was not at its limit.</p>

<p>Lachkarioff's usefulness to Germany in Russia was
at an end. He was in Gothenburg, and being a close
friend of an English journalist there, it was feared lest
he should allow himself to be interviewed, and reveal
something of the truth concerning the subterranean
working of Germany in Petrograd.</p>

<p>"The man's lips ought to be closed," Steinhauer
had written to Rasputin only a week before. "Can you
suggest any way? While he lives he will be a menace
to us all. Filimonoff is safe in an asylum in Copenhagen,
though I believe he is perfectly sane. Only it is best
that no risk should be run."</p>

<p>Here were means ready to hand to close the mouth
of Felix Lachkarioff, for the woman whom he had
betrayed was furiously vengeful.</p>

<p>"You said the other day that you would be ready
to strike a blow at that enemy of Russia who has so
grossly misled you," Rasputin said to her in a deep,
earnest voice, as she sat in his room. "Would not such
a course be deeply patriotic? Why not, as expiation
of your sin, travel to Gothenburg and avenge those
hundreds of poor people who were his victims at Obukhov?
I can give into your hand the means," he added, looking
her straight in the face.</p>

<p>"What means?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
He crossed to his writing-table, and, unlocking a
drawer with a key upon his chain, he took out a tiny
bottle of extremely expensive Parisian perfume, a pale-green
liquid, which he handed to her.</p>

<p>"It looks like scent," he remarked, with a grin, "but
it contains something else&mdash;something so potent that a
single drop introduced into food or drink will produce
death within an hour, the symptoms being exactly those
of heart disease. That is what deaths resulting from it
are always declared to be. So there is no risk. Meet
him, be friendly, dine with him for the sake of old
days in Petrograd, and before you leave him he will be
doomed," added Rasputin, in a low whisper. "He surely
deserves it after deceiving you as he has done!"</p>

<p>"He certainly does," she declared fiercely, unable to
overlook how he had betrayed her. "And I will do it!"
she added, taking up the little bottle. "Russia shall be
avenged."</p>

<p>"Excellent, my dear sister. You will indeed be
rewarded," declared Rasputin, crossing himself. "When
you return to Petrograd, give me back that precious little
bottle of perfume, which I call the Perfume of Death."</p>

<p>That the woman did not fail to carry out her promise
was certain, for within a fortnight we heard in a secret
dispatch that Hardt brought us from Berlin that the
agent Lachkarioff had died suddenly from heart disease
after dining with a Russian lady friend at the Grand
Hotel in Stockholm.</p>

<p>Truly, the grip in which Germany held Russia and
its Government was an iron one, and death most assuredly
came to those whom Berlin feared, or who were in any
way obnoxious to the German war party.</p>

<p>Ten days later a small packet was left at the house,
addressed to the monk. When I opened it I found the
little Parisian perfume bottle.</p>

<p>One morning, a week later, I went with Rasputin to
the Ministry of the Interior, where we were ushered into
the small, elegant private room of "Satan-in-a-silk-hat"
Protopopoff, who greeted us cordially. But as soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
the door was closed, and he had invited us to be seated,
he rose, turned the key, and, facing us, gravely said:</p>

<p>"Gregory, I fear something serious is about to happen.
Late last night I received an urgent visit from the Under-director
of Secret Police of Moscow, who had come post-haste
to tell me that there has been a secret meeting between
Miliukoff and the Grand Dukes Serge and Dmitri
in that city, and it has been decided that at the reopening
of the Duma Miliukoff will rise and publicly
expose us."</p>

<p>"What?" shrieked the monk, starting. "Is that
what is intended?" he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes. He apparently knows the authors of the outrage
at Obukhov and our association with them. It is
believed that he actually holds documentary evidence of
the money which we passed through the Volga-Kama
Bank, in Tula."</p>

<p>"But this must be prevented at all hazards," declared
Rasputin. "We cannot allow him to denounce us. Not
that anybody will believe him. But it is not policy at
this moment. Public opinion is highly inflamed."</p>

<p>"I agree. Of course, nobody will believe him. Yet
he is dangerous, and if he denounces us in the Duma it
will come as a bombshell. I called upon Anna Vyrubova
early this morning, and she has gone to the palace," said
Protopopoff.</p>

<p>Rasputin remained silent, his hand stroking his
ragged beard, a habit of his when working out some
scheme more devilish than others.</p>

<p>"Miliukoff will be supported by Purishkevitch, without
a doubt," His Excellency the Minister went on. "Both
are equally dangerous."</p>

<p>The "saint" grunted and knit his brows, for he saw
himself in a very perilous position. In three days' time
the Duma would re-open, and Miliukoff would probably
bring forth certain documentary evidence of the treachery
of St&uuml;rmer, Fredericks, Soukhomlinoff, Anna Vyrubova,
and a dozen others who formed the camarilla which was
working for Russia's downfall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
"The Duma must be prevented from opening," Rasputin
declared at last. "The Emperor must rescind the
order and further postpone it."</p>

<p>"The Duma has been prohibited from meeting for
over five months. It can, I agree, wait still further. His
Majesty must find some excuse, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what is passing in your mind, friend," interrupted
the monk. "Yes, I will urge Nicholas further
to prohibit it, and thus give us time to suppress our
enemies."</p>

<p>"Action must be taken at once," said the Minister.
"I had a telephone message from the secret police in
Moscow to say that Miliukoff left for Petrograd at nine
o'clock this morning. The Grand Dukes have gone
south."</p>

<p>Two hours later, on our return to the Gorokhovaya,
an Imperial courier arrived in hot haste from Tsarskoe-Selo
with a sealed note for the monk, enclosed in two
envelopes.</p>

<p>These I tore open, and, signing the outer envelope as
assurance of safe receipt, handed it to the courier, who
left. Afterwards I read the message to Rasputin, it being
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Holy Father</span>,&mdash;Anna has just told me of Miliukoff's
intention in the Duma. The Emperor must further adjourn
its re-assembling. I have telegraphed to him urging him to
do this. If not, let us adopt Noyo's suggestion to pay the
agents J. and B. ten thousand roubles to remove him. I
would willingly pay a hundred thousand roubles to close his
mouth for ever. This must be done. Suggest it to P.
[Protopopoff]. Surely the same means could be used as with
T. and L. and the end be quite natural and peaceful! You
could supply the means as before. But I urge on you not
to delay a moment. All depends upon Miliukoff's removal.
If he reveals to the Duma what he knows, then everything
must be lost. I kiss your dear hands. With Olga I ask
your blessing.&mdash;Your dutiful daughter,&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"A."</p></div>

<p>It was thus evident that the Empress knew of what
Rasputin gleefully called "The Perfume of Death."
Ah! in how many cases, I wonder, was it used by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
mock "saint" to stifle the truth and to sweep his enemies
of both sexes from his path? Such a letter as this I
have here given seems utterly incredible in this twentieth
century, yet those who knew underground Russia immediately
before the downfall of the Romanoffs will express
no surprise.</p>

<p>At once we went to Tsarskoe-Selo with all haste, and
Rasputin had a long conference in private with the
Empress and Anna, the outcome of which was that
Alexandra Feodorovna dispatched an urgent message in
cipher to the Tsar, who was still absent at South-West
Headquarters.</p>

<p>We remained at the palace all that day. At six o'clock
Anna Vyrubova entered the room, where I sat writing
some letters, and inquired for the monk.</p>

<p>"He was here a quarter of an hour ago," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then find him at once and give him this. It is most
urgent," said the high-priestess of the cult of the "sister-disciples,"
handing me a sealed envelope.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I found Rasputin walking alone on
the terrace, impatient and thoughtful, and opened the
envelope. Within was a message in Their Majesties'
private cipher, which had been deciphered by the Empress's
own hand, and which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Tell our dear Father [Rasputin] that to postpone the
Duma would, I fear, create an unfavourable impression, and
I judge impossible. Protopopoff has asked my authority to
arrest Miliukoff upon some technical charge, but I do not
consider such a course good policy. I agree that to-day's
situation is grave, and agree also that at the last moment
some means should be taken to prevent him from speaking.</p>
<p class="fsc">"Nikki."&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p></div>

<p>The monk at once flew to the Empress's side, where
St&uuml;rmer was being received in audience. Again the
situation was eagerly discussed. That night, when we
returned to Petrograd, although it was nearly midnight,
Protopopoff was summoned by telephone, and when the
pair met I learnt what had been arranged at the Palace.</p>

<p>The Empress's wishes were to be carried out. The
patriot Miliukoff was to be "removed."</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">miliukoff's exposure</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Matters</span> were now growing daily more desperate in
Russia. Suspense, unrest, and suspicion were rife everywhere,
while the deluded people were kept quiet by promises
of a great offensive in the near future.</p>

<p>The Minister Protopopoff, wearing his gorgeous uniform,
his breast covered with decorations&mdash;the man
whom Great Britain regarded as so extremely friendly&mdash;had
just paid a visit to the British Embassy, and on his
way home called upon Rasputin.</p>

<p>"It is just as we heard from Moscow," he said to
the monk anxiously. "Miliukoff intends to denounce you
at the opening of the Duma. He has been in communication
with both the French and British Embassies, and
as far as I can learn both are in entire agreement with
him."</p>

<p>"Then I must save myself," Rasputin declared, stroking
his matted beard thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The British never dream that I have been assisting
you in your schemes with Alexandra Feodorovna. That
is why they are so friendly with me at the Embassy. Indeed,
only yesterday the French Ambassador handed me
the latest report upon the output of munitions in France,
and the details of their long-range gun. These I copied,
and Hardt has left with them for Berlin."</p>

<p>"Truly, we have fooled the Allies exquisitely," laughed
the Black Monk. "But if I am denounced, you also will
be discovered as my associate, as well as St&uuml;rmer,
Fredericks, and our other friends."</p>

<p>"That is why the Empress urges you to resort to the
'perfume,'" said the much-decorated traitor.</p>

<p>"Yes, but how?" asked Rasputin. "There is no
time."</p>

<p>"There is sufficient."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest?" asked the monk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
"You know little Xenie, who married the Councillor
of State, Kalatcheff, last year? She is one of your
'sisters,' is she not?"</p>

<p>The "saint" nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, according to a secret report made to me, she
has conceived a violent hatred of Miliukoff, who was
once a friend of her husband, and who still admires her.
Miliukoff visits her home sometimes, and one day quite
recently while in her salon he denounced you. She has
been going about declaring him to be your bitterest
enemy. If so, could she not invite him to take tea with
her&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"An excellent idea!" cried Rasputin. "Xenie Kalatcheff
warned me against Miliukoff some time ago, I
recollect. I will see her and sound her upon the subject."
Then, turning to me, he asked me to inquire over the
telephone if Madame Kalatcheff was at home.</p>

<p>Five minutes later I informed the monk that the
lady was at home, and was ready to speak with him
if he wished.</p>

<p>At once Rasputin went to the instrument, and, after
greeting her gaily, asked if she could possibly come
round to see him "on a very urgent affair," to which
she at once acceded.</p>

<p>"I had better not see her, so I shall get off,"
said His Excellency. "Be careful how you treat her.
Recollect, her mind may have been poisoned against
you by Miliukoff. These members of the Duma are
often very clever and cunning."</p>

<p>"Leave the matter in my hands," said the "saint,"
with a grin. "I will soon ascertain her exact attitude,
and act accordingly. First, we must remove Miliukoff,
and next Purishkevitch&mdash;who is equally our enemy."</p>

<p>About twenty minutes later I ushered into the monk's
presence a pretty, handsomely-dressed woman of about
twenty-eight, who often attended our reunions, and who
was one of the best-known society women in Petrograd.</p>

<p>I was about to turn and leave when Rasputin said:</p>

<p>"You can remain, F&eacute;odor. The matter upon which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
I have to speak with our sister here concerns you as
well as myself."</p>

<p>Then, when the wife of the Councillor of State was
seated, Rasputin carefully approached the subject of
Miliukoff.</p>

<p>"It has been whispered to me that he is my bitter
enemy, and that he is about to speak against me in the
Duma," he said. "I believe your husband and he are
friendly. Do you happen to know if there is any truth
in this rumour?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father, I do," was madame's instant reply.
"I warned you of him three weeks ago, but you did
not heed. I also told Anna Vyrubova, but her reply was
that you, being divine, would be perfectly able to take
care of yourself."</p>

<p>"So I am. But it is against God's holy law that
human tongues should utter lies against me," he said,
cleverly impressing upon her the fact that if Miliukoff
were suppressed it would be no crime, but an act
of duty.</p>

<p>"To me, in my own house, he has declared his
intention of denouncing you&mdash;and also our dear Anna
and the Empress."</p>

<p>The monk was silent. While she was seated he
stood before her with folded arms, looking straight at
her. Suddenly, fixing her with those remarkable eyes
of his, he asked in a deep, hard voice:</p>

<p>"Xenie, will you permit this man to besmirch the
name of him whom God hath sent to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand!" she cried, surprised at his
attitude. "How can I prevent it?"</p>

<p>"It lies in your hands," declared the mock saint.
"You are his friend&mdash;and also mine. He visits your
house&mdash;what more easy&mdash;than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Than what?"</p>

<p>"Than you should invite him to take tea with you
to-morrow&mdash;to discuss myself. He knows that you are
a 'disciple,' I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has somehow learnt it&mdash;but my husband is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>
in ignorance, and he has promised not to reveal the
truth to him."</p>

<p>"If he knows of our friendship he might tell your
husband. He is unprincipled, and probably will do so.
That is why I suggest you should ask him to tea."</p>

<p>As he spoke he crossed to the writing-table, and,
opening a drawer with the key upon his chain, he took
out the tiny bottle of exquisite Parisian perfume.</p>

<p>"What is that you have there?" she asked, with
curiosity, noticing the little bottle. "Scent?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with a mysterious grin. "It is, my
dear sister, the Perfume of Death."</p>

<p>"The Perfume of Death?" she echoed. "I don't
understand!"</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you, Xenie," he replied, his great
hypnotic eyes again fixed upon her. "I do not use
perfume myself, but others sometimes, on rare occasions,
use this. It is unsuspicious, and can be left upon a
lady's dressing-table. A drop used upon a handkerchief
emits a most delicate odour, like jasmine, but a single
drop in a cup of tea means death. For two hours the
doomed person feels no effect. But suddenly he or she
becomes faint, and succumbs to heart disease."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see!" she gasped, half-starting from her
chair, her face ashen grey. "I&mdash;I realise what you
intend, Father! I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she sank back again in her chair, breathless
and aghast, without concluding her sentence.</p>

<p>"No!" she shrieked suddenly. "No; I could not be
a poisoner&mdash;a murderess! <i>Anything but that!</i>"</p>

<p>"Not for the sake of the one sent by God as saviour
of our dear Russia?" he asked reproachfully, in a low,
intense tone. "That man Miliukoff is God's enemy&mdash;and
ours. In your hand lies the means of removing him
in secret, without the least suspicion."</p>

<p>And slowly the crafty, insinuating criminal took
her inert hand, and pressed the little bottle into its
soft palm.</p>

<p>"One drop placed upon the lemon which he takes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
his tea will be sufficient," he whispered. "Only be
extremely careful of it yourself, and return the bottle to
me afterwards. It is best in my safe keeping."</p>

<p>"No! I can't!" cried the wretched woman over
whom Rasputin had now once again cast his inexplicable
spell.</p>

<p>"But you shall, Xenie! I, your holy Father, command
you to render this assistance to your land. None
shall ever know. F&eacute;odor, who knows all my innermost
secrets, will remain dumb. The world cannot suspect,
because no toxicologist has ever discovered the existence
of the perfume, nor are they able to discern that death
has not resulted from heart disease."</p>

<p>"But I should be a murderess!" gasped the unhappy
woman beneath that fateful thraldom.</p>

<p>"No. You will be fulfilling a duty&mdash;a sin imposed
upon you in order that, by committing it, you shall purify
yourself for a holy life in future," he said, referring to
one of the principles of his erotic "religion."</p>

<p>She began to waver, and instantly I saw that Rasputin
had won&mdash;as he won always with women&mdash;and that
the patriot Miliukoff had been sentenced to death.</p>

<p>"Go!" he commanded at last. "Go, and do my
bidding. Return to-morrow night, and tell me of your&mdash;<i>success</i>!"</p>

<p>Then he bowed out the reluctant but fascinated young
woman, who in her silver chain-bag carried the small
bottle of perfume.</p>

<p>That night Rasputin, after drinking half a bottle
of brandy, retired to bed, declaring that women were
only created to be the servants of men. Then I sat
down, and taking a sheet of plain and very common
writing-paper, I typed upon it a warning to the man
who, at the Empress's suggestion, was to be so ruthlessly
"removed." The words I typed were:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You will be invited to tea to-morrow by Xenie Kalatcheff.
Do not accept. There is a plot to cause your death.
This warning is from&mdash;A Friend."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
I typed an envelope with Monsieur Miliukoff's address,
and then, slipping to the door quietly, I stole
out and dropped it in the letter-box at the corner of
the Kazanskaya.</p>

<p>That I had saved the deputy's life I knew next
afternoon when Madame Kalatcheff sent round a hurried
note to Rasputin, explaining that, though she had invited
him to her house, he had rather curtly refused
the invitation.</p>

<p>At this the monk telephoned her to come round, and
once again she sat in his room explaining that she had
sent Miliukoff a note urging him to see her at four o'clock,
as she wished to make some revelations concerning the
monk that might be useful to him when speaking in
the Duma. The reply, which she produced, was certainly
couched in most indignant terms.</p>

<p>"Can he suspect, do you think, F&eacute;odor?" he asked,
turning to me.</p>

<p>"How can he?" I asked. "Perhaps, knowing
madame to be a 'disciple,' he doubts the genuineness of
her promised disclosures."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," Xenie said. "But what can I do if
he suspects me? Nothing that I can see."</p>

<p>The pair sat anxiously discussing the situation for
the next half-hour, until at last the State Councillor's
wife, handing back the little bottle of perfume to the
monk, rose and left.</p>

<p>I was secretly much gratified that I had been able
to save the Deputy's life, yet Rasputin continued to
discuss other plans with me, repeating:</p>

<p>"The fellow must die. Alexandra Feodorovna has
willed it. While he lives he will always be a constant
menace. He must die! He <i>shall</i> die!"</p>

<p>Our national hymn, "Boje Tzaria khrani" ("God save
the Tsar"), was being sung at the moment in the streets,
because news of a victory in Poland had just been given
out to the public.</p>

<p>Already the foundation stone of the revolution had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
been laid, and M. Miliukoff, with purely patriotic motives,
had assisted in cementing it. The Senatorial revision
which was ordained to inquire into General Soukhomlinoff's
treachery had, owing to Miliukoff's activity, ordered a
search at the amorous old fellow's private abode early
in the spring, with the result that he found himself
incarcerated in the fortress of Peter and Paul. When
the general was arrested, madame his wife&mdash;an adventuress
named Gaskevitch, who had commenced life as a
typist in a solicitor's office, and who was many years
his junior&mdash;had a terrible attack of hysteria, for things
had taken for her a most unexpected turn. The woman
had been implicated in intrigue and treachery ever since.
After copying some secret papers for a man in Kiev, she
had blackmailed him, obtained a big sum of money, and
then married a man named Boulovitch, a prosperous
landed proprietor. By thus entering the higher circle of
society in Kiev, she got to know General Soukhomlinoff,
its Governor-General, who connived with her to obtain
a divorce from Boulovitch, so that she subsequently
married the bald-headed old Don Juan a few months after
his appointment as War Minister.</p>

<p>Madame and Rasputin were ever hand-in-glove. From
the moment the general was arrested she had worked
with singular energy and adroitness to retrieve her
husband's fallen fortune, and in doing so she assisted
to lay the beginning of the first Revolution. She enlisted
the sympathy of Rasputin, Anna Vyrubova and the
Empress, all of whom were gravely apprehensive as to
what might come out at the general's trial. She even
threw herself at the feet of Alexandra Feodorovna,
imploring her to intercede with the Emperor so as to
save her calumniated and injured husband. And at last
she succeeded.</p>

<p>The inquiries were suspended, the newspapers were
silent regarding the scandal, and suddenly it became
known that, "owing to the general's mental state," it
had been decided, on the advice of a board of well-known
medical specialists, to liberate him!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
This astounding news passed from mouth to mouth,
and Miliukoff, the patriotic fire-brand, declared everywhere
that it was Rasputin's work. The news produced
the most sinister impression upon the people, especially
on those connected with the Army. The man who had
been the primary cause of Russia's reverses was to
escape punishment! It was, indeed, this insensate act
of folly on the part of the Tsar which had undermined
the people's trust in their Emperor, and gave Rasputin's
enemies&mdash;and more especially Miliukoff&mdash;opportunity for
his bitter denunciation.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day before the opening of
the Duma, Rasputin received another letter from the
Empress, in cipher, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>,&mdash;Nikki still refuses to postpone the
Duma, though I have done all I can to induce him to do
so. Come to us at once and try to force him to our views.
Not a moment should be lost. I have just heard that Miliukoff
is still active, so conclude that what you told me has
failed.</p>

<p>"P. [Protopopoff] has told me an hour ago that Skoropadski
[a German agent living in Petrograd as a jeweller
in the Nevski] has betrayed us all, and has placed some
most incriminating documents in the hands of Miliukoff,
who has, in turn, shown them to <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Purishkevich'">Purishkevitch</ins>. They will
be produced in the Duma to-morrow. The police traced
Skoropadski to Riga, but they have failed to arrest him,
and he has, alas! escaped to Sweden.</p>

<p>"Holy Father, do not delay a moment in coming to your
daughter to comfort her in this her blackest hour! Miliukoff
must be prevented from <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'denouncng'">denouncing</ins> you. I cannot conceive
how your arrangement with Madame Kalatcheff has
failed. The perfume has never failed before. Alix is
constantly asking for you, and Olga kisses your dear hand.
Seek the Emperor at once before coming to me, or he may
suspect us to be in collusion. I have quarrelled with him,
because by his obstinacy he will ruin us all. How I wish
that Miliukoff would be stricken down! Do not delay.
Come!&mdash;Your devoted daughter,</p>
<p class="fsc">"A."&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p></div>

<p>Well I knew that the German-born Empress was
sitting alone in the palace breathlessly anxious as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
what disclosures were forthcoming. She was not blind
to her increasing unpopularity and to the unkind things
said openly of her. Somebody had just started a rumour
that there was a secret wireless plant at the palace,
by which she could communicate direct with Potsdam.
Indeed, so many people believed this that, after the
Tsar's abdication, every nook, corner and garret of Tsarskoe-Selo
was searched, but without success. St&uuml;rmer,
Fredericks, Protopopoff, the poison-monger Badmayev,
Anna Vyrubova, and half-a-dozen others, who formed
the dark and sinister forces that were rapidly hurling
Russia to her doom, were that day as anxious and
terrified as the Empress herself. Well they knew that
if Miliukoff, armed with those incriminating documents&mdash;the
exact nature of which they knew not&mdash;spoke the
truth in the Legislature, then a storm of indignation
would sweep over them in such a manner that they
could never withstand it.</p>

<p>Rasputin, thus summoned, went at once to the palace,
and I accompanied him. He proceeded straight to the
Emperor's private room, while I waited in a room
adjoining.</p>

<p>I heard their voices raised. The Emperor's was raised
in protest; that of the monk in angry threats.</p>

<p>"If thou wilt not postpone the Duma, then the peril
will be upon thine own head!" I heard Rasputin shout.
"Why allow these revolutionary deputies to criticise thy
policy and undermine thy popularity with the nation?
It is folly! Such policy is suicidal, and if thou wilt
persist I shall withdraw and return to my home, well
knowing that to-morrow the day of Russia's doom will
dawn."</p>

<p>"The people are clamouring for the reopening of
the Duma," replied the Emperor weakly. "I can do
nothing else but submit."</p>

<p>"I have had a vision," declared the monk. "Last
night there was revealed unto me the dire result of thy
folly. I saw thee, the victim of thy nation's anger,
dethroned, degraded and imprisoned."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
But even that lie failed to induce the Tsar to alter
his decision, and naturally so, for he was afraid of the
dark cloud which he saw rising, and which he believed
to be due to the long adjournment of the Duma. Hence
he was afraid to take the monk's advice.</p>

<p>Again I heard both men's voices raised in hot
argument.</p>

<p>"I am Emperor!" cried the Tsar at last, angrily,
in a high, shrill tone, "and I refuse to be thus dictated
to!"</p>

<p>Next second there was a loud crash of glass, and
I heard Rasputin shout:</p>

<p>"Thou refuseth to listen to good counsel! As I
have smashed that bowl, so will the people, I tell thee,
rise and smash the House of Romanoff!"</p>

<p>With those words he turned, and a moment later
rejoined me, his face flushed with anger, and his knotted
fingers clenched.</p>

<p>He went straight to the Empress and told her of
his failure to move Nicholas from his decision.</p>

<p>"But surely this man Miliukoff must be prevented
from speaking!" cried the unhappy woman, who saw all
her deep-laid schemes crumbling rapidly away, and herself
branded as a traitress. "Father, you must work yet
another miracle. He must be seized by a sudden illness&mdash;an
accident must happen to him, or&mdash;or something!"</p>

<p>Rasputin shook his head dubiously, declaring that
there was no time to arrange a second attempt.</p>

<p>"Have you put it to Protopopoff?" she asked. "He
might suggest some means, now that the woman Kalatcheff
has failed us. If not&mdash;he will speak&mdash;and we are
lost! Think, Father, what it all means! There is already
public unrest created by the rumours that we have unfortunately
spread of pending disaster, and if they are
followed by such charges supported by documents, then
revolution is inevitable!"</p>

<p>I saw that the Tsaritza, now that every means to
secure Miliukoff's silence had failed, was terrified lest
she be exhibited in her own true traitorous colours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
Back we went to Petrograd, where we called at
Protopopoff's house, and where still another attempt
against Miliukoff's life was plotted.</p>

<p>By telephone an ex-agent of Secret Police named
Stefanovitch, who had done much work as an <i>agent-provocateur</i>
for the camarilla, was called, and a price
was at once arranged for the murder of the Deputy.</p>

<p>He was to be shot at and killed outside the Tauris
Palace, just before two o'clock, as he was entering
the Duma. He would probably be walking round to
the Chamber from his house with his bosom friend
M. Purishkevitch.</p>

<p>"You will surely know somebody to whom the affair
can be entrusted, Ivan," said the Minister of the Interior.
"If arrested, he will be allowed ample opportunity to
escape. Naturally he would not come up for trial. I
would see to that. So you can give him my personal
assurance."</p>

<p>"I should suggest a woman," said the man Stefanovitch.
"I know one who would not hesitate to act as
we wish. Her name is Marie Grozdoff, a Polish Jewess.
I can trust her. She has done something similar for
us before."</p>

<p>"And the price?"</p>

<p>"The price will be all right," replied the provocating
agent, with a business-like air.</p>

<p>"Then we entrust the affair to you, Ivan," said His
Excellency. "You will receive for yourself ten thousand
roubles if Miliukoff dies."</p>

<p>And the man went forth to find the woman, who, for
money, would not hesitate to commit murder.</p>

<p>That night proved a sleepless one for us all. I
tried to warn Miliukoff again by sending him an anonymous
letter, which I posted in secret after the
monk had retired. But my great fear was lest the letter
would not reach his hand in time. Probably it would not
be delivered till the midday post&mdash;and if so, he would
not see it till after the opening of the Duma!</p>

<p>Next morning passed anxiously. Protopopoff had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
told us over the telephone that Stefanovitch had seen the
woman Grozdoff, and that all was arranged.</p>

<p>I went early to the Duma, and sat among the
crowd in the public gallery, while Rasputin remained
at home, and the Empress at the palace, with Anna
near the telephone, she having arranged for brief
reports of the proceedings to be telephoned to her
at intervals of a quarter of an hour each during
the sitting.</p>

<p>M. Michael Rodzianko, the President, gravely took
his seat on the stroke of two, and the House was
crowded. The diplomatic boxes were filled to overflowing,
the British, French, Italian and United States Ambassadors,
together with the Ministers of most of the neutral
countries, being present.</p>

<p>The usual prayer was offered, but neither M. Miliukoff
nor M. Purishkevitch was in his place!</p>

<p>Had the attempt been successful? I held my breath
and wondered. I had been listening for a shot, but
heard nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly my heart gave a bound. A pleasant-looking,
grey-haired man, in gold-rimmed spectacles, and carrying
a big bundle of papers, had entered by the back way,
and was walking to his seat. It was M. Miliukoff! He
had had my anonymous letter, and had come in by the
back way, being followed by his bearded, bald-headed
friend. Once again had I been able to warn him of
danger.</p>

<p>The Government was now dancing upon a volcano.</p>

<p>The sitting opened, the President Rodzianko made a
speech in which he criticised severely the policy of the
St&uuml;rmer Government, and everyone realised the seriousness
of the situation now that the President of the Duma
came out against the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>"The Government must learn from us what the
country needs," said Rodzianko fiercely. "The Government
must not follow a path different from the people.
With the confidence of the nation it must head the social
forces in the march toward victory over the enemy, along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
the path that harmonises with the aspirations of the
people. There is no other path to be followed."</p>

<p>Then the President went on to declare that, though
there was no discord among the Allies, yet there was no
trick that the enemy would not play with the treacherous
object of wrecking their alliance. "Russia will not betray
her friends," he declared, "and I say she, with
contempt, refuses any consideration of a separate peace."</p>

<p>The speech was greeted with thunderous outbursts of
applause, while St&uuml;rmer, who was present, rose and left
after its conclusion.</p>

<p>Then, when the applause and cheering of the Ambassadors
of the Allies had died down; Paul Miliukoff, the
brilliant leader of the Constitutional Democrats, rose
gravely and began to speak.</p>

<p>That speech, which the camarilla had vainly striven
strenuously to suppress, proved historic, and was mainly
the cause of St&uuml;rmer's overthrow. Boldly and relentlessly
he showed his hearers the favour with which the
Teutons regarded St&uuml;rmer and the consternation caused
in the Allied camp by his activities. Reading extracts
from German and Austrian newspapers, he brought out
the fact that the Central Powers regarded St&uuml;rmer as a
member "of those circles which look on the war against
Germany without particular enthusiasm"; that St&uuml;rmer's
appointment to the Foreign Ministry was greeted in the
Teutonic countries as the beginning of a new era in
Russian politics, while the dismissal of Sazonov produced
in the Entente countries an effect "such as would have
been produced by a pogrom."</p>

<p>The crowning sensation, however, was what he revealed
concerning St&uuml;rmer's connection with the blackmailing
operations of his private secretary, Manasevitch-Manuiloff,
who, a few weeks before, had been arrested
on a charge of bribery. The secretary told the directors
of a Petrograd bank that proceedings were being instituted
against them by the Ministry of the Interior for alleged
trading with the enemy, and offered to suppress the affair
"through influential friends" for a large consideration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
The representatives of the bank had special reasons
to get even with the "dark forces," and especially Protopopoff,
since the retired Minister of the Interior, A. N.
Khvostov, was a brother of the bank's president.
Khvostov owed his dismissal to a plot to kill Rasputin,
which was investigated by Manuiloff. The directors of
the bank, therefore, accepted the fellow's offer, handing
him over a large sum of money in marked notes.</p>

<p>Later Manuiloff was arrested by the military authorities
with the bribe in his possession. His release, however,
followed soon, and the name of Manuiloff was on
everybody's lips. Miliukoff, in his speech, said, regarding
Manuiloff's liberation:</p>

<p>"Why was this gentleman arrested? That has been
known long ago, and I shall be saying nothing new
if I tell you what you already know, namely, that he was
arrested for extorting bribes, and that he was liberated
because&mdash;that is also no secret&mdash;he told the examining
magistrates that he shared the bribes with the President
of the Council of Ministers."</p>

<p>Thus was Boris St&uuml;rmer denounced as a traitor and
blackmailer!</p>

<p>But worse was to follow. M. Miliukoff vehemently
condemned the Empress for her support of the plan,
originated in Germany, of a speedy and separate peace,
regardless of circumstances, conditions, or national
honour. He quoted further passages from German newspapers,
in which "<i>die Friedens-partei der jungen Tzarin</i>"
(the Peace Party of the young Tsaritza) was freely discussed.
He was very outspoken in referring to the
"dark forces" which surrounded the Throne and had
lately assumed such overwhelming dimensions, and he
openly declared "that man, the monk Gregory Rasputin,
the ex-horse-stealer and pet saint of Alexandra Feodorovna,
is, gentlemen, nothing more than an erotic
charlatan, who is the catspaw of the Kaiser!"</p>

<p>The effect of this was electrical. The House sat
staggered.</p>

<p>"Yes, gentlemen," he went on, striking the bundle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
papers which lay upon the desk before him, "I have here
documentary evidence of the traitorous actions of this
camarilla, who are attempting to lead Russia to her doom&mdash;papers
which shall be revealed to you all in due course.
It is said that the Prime Minister has already left the
Chamber to make a personal report to His Majesty of
the President's speech. All I trust is that the words I
have just uttered will also reach the Emperor's ears, and
that he will trouble himself to examine the irrefutable
evidence of Rasputin's diabolical work at the Palace
and in the Ministries, and the crafty machinations of the
'black forces' in our midst."</p>

<p>The Manuiloff disclosures were sufficiently dramatic,
but this outspoken exposure of Rasputin, the more bitter,
perhaps, because of my warnings of the two attempts to
assassinate him, caused the House to gasp.</p>

<p>The very name of Rasputin had only been breathed
in whispers, and his cult was referred to vaguely as
something mysterious connected with the occult. But
in that speech, to which I sat and listened, Miliukoff hit
straight from the shoulder, and called a spade a spade.
One of his phrases was, "Russia can never win so long
as this convicted criminal and seducer of women is
allowed to work his amazing power upon the rulers of
the Empire. Remove him!" he went on. "Let him be
placed safely within the walls of Peter and Paul, together
with his 'sisters,' and with all his brother-traitors, and
then there will be no more suggestion of a separate peace.
Remove his evil influence!" shouted the fine orator, his
voice ringing through the Chamber. "I say, remove him
from the Imperial circle, or Russia is doomed!"</p>

<p>I left the Duma by that long stone staircase with a
feeling that at last the power behind the Throne, nay,
the very Throne itself, was broken.</p>

<p>I sped to Rasputin's house, and with pretended regret
related all that had occurred.</p>

<p>Hearing it, he sprang to the telephone, declaring in a
hoarse voice: "The Censor must prohibit every word of
it from publication. I will demand this of Nicholas!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
And a few moments later he was speaking with the
Emperor, urging that an order to the Censor be immediately
issued&mdash;a suggestion that was at once carried
out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a dramatic scene was being enacted in the
Empress's boudoir, for that day proved the beginning
of the end of the holy Father's career, as well as that of
Alexandra Feodorovna, Empress of Russia.</p>



<hr class="full" />

<h3><span class="smcap">the traitor denounced</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Empress, on hearing what had happened in the
Duma, had a fit of hysterics. Nicholas was present
while the Court physician administered restoratives.
Then, without a word, he turned, and, leaving his wife
in the care of the traitress Anna Vyrubova, he left for
General Headquarters.</p>

<p>When Rasputin was informed by telephone of the
Emperor's departure he became furious.</p>

<p>"He fears to meet St&uuml;rmer!" he cried to me. "He
is leaving him in the lurch."</p>

<p>And this he did, for the next day the fate of Russia
trembled in the balance, while the Black Monk went
about to the Ministers in frantic haste, hoping and
plotting to turn public opinion again in his favour. The
charlatan, who could work miracles, and was the Heaven-sent
saviour of Russia, had been exposed as a mere impostor.
St&uuml;rmer's position had also become desperate
under the concerted attacks of the Duma. A meeting of
the Cabinet was held, at which the monk was present.
St&uuml;rmer, with Protopopoff's support, proposed to dissolve
the Duma. Some members opposed the suggestion,
whereupon St&uuml;rmer resolved to execute it upon his own
initiative.</p>

<p>In Rasputin's room, and in my presence, he drew up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
a document to that effect, but to make it law it required
the Tsar's consent, and Nicholas was far away. It was
St&uuml;rmer or the Duma.</p>

<p>Alexandra Feodorovna and Rasputin were both working
with St&uuml;rmer to dissolve the people's representatives,
and again prevent them from reassembling.</p>

<p>As Rasputin put it to me clearly that night:</p>

<p>"F&eacute;odor, this is a great crisis. The Duma and
St&uuml;rmer are incompatible. The victory of the latter will
mean revolution. The triumph of the Duma will indicate
the winning of the battle by the democracy. To achieve
his purpose, St&uuml;rmer needs an audience with the Tsar,
and he must have it. Alexandra Feodorovna seems to be
failing us, for Nicholas has hidden himself, hoping that
the storm will blow over."</p>

<p>St&uuml;rmer strained every effort to obtain audience with
the Emperor, but he was elusive, and for days no one
knew where he was. An audience would mean the dissolution
of the Duma, and this Nicholas feared would
bring revolution.</p>

<p>As is well known, by a record published by an American
journalist, there suddenly appeared in the Duma the
Ministers of War and Marine, General Shuvaiev and
Admiral Grigorovitch. They announced that they had a
statement to make. The representatives of the people
held their breath in suspense. The War Minister
mounted the tribune, and paid a tribute to the people's
efforts in the cause of national defence, requesting the
Duma's and the country's future co-operation in the
work of equipping the army. The Minister of Marine
reiterated General Shuvaiev's demand for co-operation
between the Government and the Duma. The latter,
perhaps, never witnessed such a scene as that which followed
the two Ministers' speeches. There was a great
ovation, after which Miliukoff rose and said:</p>

<p>"The War and Marine Ministers have declared themselves
on the side of the Duma and the people. We, on
our part, have said that the Duma is with the army and
the people."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
This sealed the fate of Boris St&uuml;rmer. The people
had achieved their first victory over the "dark forces,"
and St&uuml;rmer, driven out, came one night to us, and,
pacing the room, tore his beard and cursed both the
Emperor and Empress.</p>

<p>Then, turning upon Rasputin, he cried with a
sneer:</p>

<p>"And you, the holy Father and our divine guide, have
been powerless to save us! Where are your miraculous
powers? Only in your own imagination, I am beginning
to think."</p>

<p>These words led to a serious quarrel and bitter recriminations,
for the Empress, to save herself, had dropped
St&uuml;rmer, so that Protopopoff had become instantly the
favourite at Court, and, indeed, dictator.</p>

<p>Two weeks went by, weeks of the tensest scenes in
the contest between the democracy and the conspirators,
of whom Rasputin and the Empress were the head. Protopopoff
defied the new Premier, Alexander Trepov, a
hide-bound bureaucrat, as well as the Duma, and it was
then that the crisis was reached.</p>

<p>Each day we went regularly to Tsarskoe-Selo, and
there another plot was quickly hatched. While the public
were daily expecting the downfall of Protopopoff as a
natural outcome of St&uuml;rmer's denunciation and degradation,
they were one day suddenly staggered by the news
that the retired Premier was about to be appointed Ambassador
to a neutral country.</p>

<p>Everywhere I went I heard the most sinister dissatisfaction.
The people knew what was meant, namely, that
the Germanophile St&uuml;rmer was to negotiate a premature
peace, and this within three weeks of his downfall! The
whole Empire was agog at the news, yet Rasputin remained
calm and silent, believing that his clever plot
would be successful.</p>

<p>Certainly it might have been had not the Duma continued
its concerted attack on the "dark forces," demanding
a responsible Ministry. Even half of the Extreme
Right, the most rabid monarchical faction in the Duma,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
joined the Opposition, a fact which, when told to the
Empress, sent her again into hysterics.</p>

<p>I remember that day well. Hardt had arrived hot-foot
from Berlin, and brought the monk a dispatch which,
when deciphered, read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Memorandum from No. 70. A.43,286.</span></p>
<p class="figright">"November 8th, 1916.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>"The attitude of the Duma is creating much alarm for
your personal safety. As you have failed to suppress Miliukoff,
endeavour at once to remove his chief supporter Purishkevitch.
Inform A. [Anna Vyrubova] that Korniloff has
revealed to P. her duplicity in the Zarudni affair, and P. has
in his possession certain documents incriminating her.
These should be secured at all hazards. [G. Zarudni, active
in political law cases, and who was, after the Revolution,
appointed Minister of Justice in the Kerensky Cabinet.]
P. intends to make use of these in the Duma. It is suggested,
therefore, that the woman X. [Xenie Kalatcheff] be again
given the perfume, with instructions from yourself. If not,
employ the girl Olga Bauer. She posed as a domestic
servant in the Princess Tchekmareff affair, and was successful.
Why not utilise her again?</p>

<p>"Inform Her Majesty that St&uuml;rmer must come back to
power very shortly. But this is impossible while Miliukoff
and Purishkevitch have the ear of the people. Not a second
should be lost in suppressing them. We have heard with
satisfaction of the removal of the woman Marya Ustryaloff
and the man Paul Krizhitsky. Both knew too much, and,
though they served us faithfully, were not further required.
[When the sphere of usefulness of German secret agents ends
they generally meet with untimely deaths.]</p>

<p>"Also inform Her Majesty that she and her daughters
should exhibit a keener interest in the wounded in order to
win back public favour. You, too, should perform another
miracle.</p>

<p>"We hear with regret that, though the allegations made
by Miliukoff were suppressed by the Censor, typewritten
copies of the speech are being widely distributed everywhere.
If you do not act with a firm hand, this will upset all our
plans. The moment is critical, and all depends upon your
own drastic actions.&mdash;Greeting,</p>
<p class="figright">"S." [Steinhauer].&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p></div>

<p>That same evening the bearded blackguard communicated
to the Tsaritza and the elegant <i>morphineuse</i>
Anna Vyrubova the contents of the secret dispatch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
Both Empress and lady-in-waiting, in their rich evening
gowns, came to the fine apartments which were
allotted to the monk in the palace, and as they were
seated I read over the message.</p>

<p>"Yes," declared Her Majesty when I had finished;
"I quite agree that the girl Olga Bauer should receive
instructions. Order Protopopoff to make inquiry into
the best means by which she can approach Purishkevitch.
The fellow must be prevented from implicating our dear
Anna in the Zarudni affair."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Madame Vyrubova in alarm; "it would
ruin not only myself, but the Empress also."</p>

<p>"I will do thy bidding," Rasputin responded, standing
with his hands behind his back, his great cross
suspended from his neck scintillating beneath the light.</p>

<p>"The girl Bauer, posing as a domestic servant,
managed to ingratiate herself with Prince Tchekmareff,
and gave the perfume to her mistress with success,"
remarked Anna. "And there was not the slightest suspicion.
Xenie Kalatcheff failed, therefore I am not in
favour of her being employed again."</p>

<p>"True, Olga is a girl of great daring, and her lover
has long been in the German service," Rasputin remarked.
"I will see her to-morrow." Then, turning to me, he
said: "F&eacute;odor, write to her and ask her to call on
me to-morrow evening at eight. Send the letter by
special messenger."</p>

<p>This I did, and next evening the girl Bauer called.
She was slim, very pretty, and dressed as she was,
as a girl of the people, none would suspect her of
having committed several secret murders at Rasputin's
instructions.</p>

<p>"Olga," he said, when she was shown into his room,
"really you are growing prettier each day! I envy Ivan
Ivanovitch, for he has good taste."</p>

<p>"You flatter me, Father," said the girl, blushing.</p>

<p>"I speak the truth," declared the monk, twisting the
end of his beard in his fingers and fixing his strange
eyes upon hers. "But," he went on, "I asked you here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
because I want you to help our cause once again&mdash;with
the perfume."</p>

<p>She grew serious in an instant.</p>

<p>"Who is obnoxious?" she asked quickly, in a hard
voice.</p>

<p>"Purishkevitch," declared the monk. "The man has
somewhere in his house certain incriminating papers
regarding Madame Vyrubova. These, however, do not
concern you. When the Deputy is dead I will have the
police search the house at once, and the papers when
found will be handed to me. You must repeat the r&ocirc;le
you played in Prince Tchekmareff's household."</p>

<p>With these words he rose and took from a drawer
he unlocked a small bottle containing a piece of cotton-wool,
saying:</p>

<p>"This wool has been soaked in the perfume and
dried, so that it is more easily carried and less suspicious
than in liquid form. Just place a little water
on the wool and squeeze it out, when you have the
perfume ready to hand."</p>

<p>The pretty girl took the little wide-mouthed bottle
and held it against the light.</p>

<p>"The Deputy will be difficult to approach," she said.
"He is not a fast-living man, like some with whom I
have dealt."</p>

<p>"He will not be able to resist a pretty face like
yours," Rasputin said confidently.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at last, "I will try, Father. Give
me your blessing."</p>

<p>And she went upon her knees, while the erotic blackguard
placed his dirty hands upon her head, and, raising
his eyes to Heaven, pretended to place upon her his
benediction.</p>

<p>Afterwards, before she left us, she told us that she
knew that the Deputy had a young man-servant named
Protzenko, and it would be her object to first attract
his attention and become on intimate terms with him, by
which means she would be enabled to visit the servants'
quarters of Purishkevitch's house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
"Excellent&mdash;if you do not think that you could obtain
a place there as servant."</p>

<p>"That would be difficult, for I happen to know that
all the servants have been there for years, and that there
is no vacancy."</p>

<p>"Well, Olga, act just as you like," the monk said.
"Only remove him, and then telephone instantly to me,
so that the police can search immediately."</p>

<p>Of the girl Bauer we heard nothing for a fortnight.
Time after time I felt impelled to warn the doomed
man, but I feared lest Rasputin should suspect me of
treachery, the other plots having failed. One night, while
at the palace, I was informed by a flunkey that someone
wished to speak with the monk on the public telephone,
therefore I went to the instrument.</p>

<p>The voice I heard was that of Olga Bauer, who,
when she recognised me, said:</p>

<p>"Tell the Father that his wishes were carried out
half an hour ago. You know what I mean&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "I know&mdash;I will tell him at once."
And then I rang off.</p>

<p>Returning to Rasputin's handsome room I repeated
the message, whereupon he sprang up with eager delight,
and ringing up Protopopoff at his house in
Petrograd, told him to order an immediate police search
of Purishkevitch's house, as had already been arranged.</p>

<p>After that I had some business with the Master of
the Imperial Household in the opposite wing of the palace,
and it was not till half-an-hour later that I re-entered
the "saint's" room.</p>

<p>I found Rasputin foaming with rage and stamping
up and down the room in fury.</p>

<p>"I told the Empress and Anna the good news, now
to find that it is false!" he cried. "The police made
a domiciliary visit only to be greeted by Purishkevitch
himself. Think of it!"</p>

<p>"Then the fellow is not dead!" I gasped in amazement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
"No. He is still alive. His valet Protzenko died
an hour ago. That fool of a girl has blundered!"</p>

<p>As he uttered these words the door opened and the
Empress appeared, looking pale and desperate.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, "this is a very serious contretemps
for us all. How do we not know that the girl
Bauer purposely removed the valet in place of his master?
The visit of the police will arouse the suspicion of our
enemy, and he may trace the crime to his valet's female
acquaintance. What then?"</p>

<p>"I had never thought of that!" replied the monk,
halting erect before her. "She might, in that case,
betray us! Truly thou hast spoken words of wisdom!"</p>

<p>"Yes. In the girl I discern a possible enemy&mdash;and
in this crisis we should take no risks."</p>

<p>"I agree. I will take steps. If she has betrayed
us, then she shall be tried for the murder of Princess
Tchekmareff. Whatever allegations she makes against
me will not be allowed to transpire at the trial."</p>

<p>"Or get Nikki to sign an order for her banishment to
Siberia as an exile," suggested the scheming Empress.</p>

<p>"Ah! my daughter, thou art always wise. An excellent
plan! I will first make inquiries, and then ask for the
Emperor's signature."</p>

<p>Though matters had assumed the most serious aspect
in those last days of November, Rasputin, bent upon
revenge and full of chagrin at being unable to obtain
possession of those incriminating letters of the high
priestess of his disgraceful cult, Madame Vyrubova, was
busy making inquiries, and among those he questioned
was Ivan Ivanovitch, a bookbinder in Petrograd, who was
Olga's lover, and who regarded the monk with considerable
disfavour, a fact of which Rasputin was unaware.</p>

<p>The young man, in consequence of the nature of the
questions put to him by the monk, guessed what was
in his mind, and that same day told Olga that Rasputin
disbelieved her story how the valet had drunk the glass
of k&uuml;mmel that had been poured out for his master, and
that, full of chagrin, he was plotting a revenge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
Of this we knew nothing till afterwards. But on
the same night as Ivan Ivanovitch revealed the truth to
her Olga called upon Rasputin, and I admitted her.</p>

<p>"I wish to see the Father," she said, in a deep,
earnest voice.</p>

<p>"I will go and see if he will receive you," I answered,
and I left her in the ante-room.</p>

<p>Rasputin ordered her to be shown in, whereupon, as
soon as she crossed the threshold, she drew a revolver,
and, dashing toward him, fired. The bullet missed, and
she fired again, also without effect, before I could rush
up and seize her. She struggled with me with a strength
born of madness.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, woman?" asked the monk,
standing with his arms folded, while I held her wrists,
the weapon having fallen upon the polished floor during
our wild struggle.</p>

<p>"It means that I intend to rid the world of a base
blackguard and betrayer of women!" she said. "I have
been in your toils and done your dirty work, and now,
because I have failed, you intend to denounce me, and
so close my lips. But they will never be closed. The
evidence which Purishkevitch holds is complete. I have
seen it. Protzenko discovered me tampering with his
master's papers, so I first assured him it was out of
curiosity, and then I gave him a little of the perfume."</p>

<p>We both stood aghast at learning the truth.</p>

<p>"It surprises you!" she shrieked, still in my grip.
"But you may be more surprised when you know that I
have become a friend and partisan of the Deputy, and
that with Ivan I have united to hasten the downfall of
you&mdash;the Black Monk of Petrograd!"</p>

<p>"Silence, woman!" thundered Rasputin, casting an
evil glance at her. "Hold her, F&eacute;odor. I will lock
the door!"</p>

<p>Then, picking up the revolver, he strode to the door,
which he locked and took the key. Passing to the
telephone, he was soon speaking with Protopopoff, whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
he ordered to send police officers to conduct the girl Bauer
to the fortress of Peter and Paul.</p>

<p>"And I also order you to arrest the girl's lover, Ivan
Ivanovitch, as a dangerous political. You know his
address," he said to the Minister.</p>

<p>"Now you can release her!" he added, turning to
me. "And write at my dictation."</p>

<p>The girl stood staggered at hearing Rasputin's orders
to the Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she shrieked. "Forgive me! forgive
me, Father! I&mdash;I was mad&mdash;<i>mad!</i> Ivan urged me to
do this&mdash;to kill you!"</p>

<p>"Write as I tell you, F&eacute;odor," Rasputin ordered.</p>

<p>Then, as I sat at the table, he dictated the following
lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is by our order that the woman Olga Alexandrovna
Bauer, native of Orel, shall be deported without trial to
Yakutsk, in Eastern Siberia, and there sent to penal servitude
for life. And further, that Ivan Ivanovitch shall be
confined for life in the Fortress of Schl&uuml;sselburg. Given at
our Palace of Tsarskoe-Selo, December 1st, 1916."</p></div>

<p>"The Emperor will sign that to-morrow," he added.</p>

<p>The unfortunate girl, shrieking loudly, threw herself
at the feet of the monk, imploring forgiveness.</p>

<p>"No, my pretty one!" he replied. "You would open
your lips if I gave you the chance. But you will not
have it. You are my enemy, and the enemies of Gregory
Rasputin never prevail for long, for he takes good care
of that!"</p>

<p>She had a fit of hysterics, but quickly came to consciousness
again, only to find herself in the hands of
six grey-coated police officers, who roughly bundled
her out into the hall, shrieking and cursing the blasphemous
blackguard who was the real ruler of the
Empire.</p>

<p>An hour after the girl Bauer had been taken away a
secret messenger from Berlin brought us another dispatch
in cipher, which, when I decoded it, read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">"Memorandum from No. 70.   68,428. G.</span></p>

<p>"Instructions from the Emperor William are to the effect
that Germany will deliver a peace offer to Russia on
December 12th. Inform Her Majesty of this, and tell her to
use all her influence with the Emperor and all the Ministers
towards an acceptance.</p>

<p>"Instructions to our friend P. [Protopopoff] are to continue
his destructive activities. He must muzzle the Press
more closely, hold up all food, and continue provocative
work in all quarters. It is only by producing extreme suffering
that you can bring about an uprising for peace. Code
now changed to No. 5.&mdash;Greetings,</p>
<p class="figright">"S."</p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>

<p>Duly the German offer of peace was made on December
12th, and Russia was tottering to her doom. The
offer, engineered by the "black forces," gave opportunity
to the Duma to express its pent-up feelings. Both
Miliukoff and his friend who had so narrowly escaped the
"perfume" declared publicly that the camarilla favoured
the acceptance of the offer.</p>

<p>Of the truth of this I can myself vouch, for Alexandra
Feodorovna had, since her holy Father had received the
secret dispatch, spared no effort to induce the Emperor
and the Cabinet to accept the olive branch.</p>

<p>Nicholas refused. Whatever may be said of him, I
know personally that on many occasions he proved his
loyalty to the Allies against the evil counsels of St&uuml;rmer
and the others.</p>

<p>The nation, however, had to be pacified, so the Tsar
called the newly-appointed Foreign Minister, Petrovsky,
who represented the best type of bureaucrat, and instructed
him how to act. In consequence, three days
after the Teuton proposal was made, he announced
Russia's rejection of a "premature peace." Immediately
after the Foreign Minister's declaration, the Duma passed
a resolution, which contained the following declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Having heard the statement by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, the Duma unanimously favours a categorical
refusal by the Allied Governments to enter, under
present conditions, into any peace negotiations whatever."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
Truly, public opinion was becoming more than ever
inflamed.</p>

<p>Yet "Satan in a silk hat," seated in the Ministry of
the Interior, was working his evil machinations upon
the nation to create the greatest possible suffering and
unrest, as his taskmaster in Berlin had ordered. And
in this he had an able assistant in the unwashed "saint,"
who a few days before, in collusion with his friend the
ex-conjurer, had in a low quarter of Petrograd performed
a trick which all believed to be a "miracle."</p>

<p>One of Protopopoff's schemes, which he successfully
carried out, was that of sowing discontent among the
masses by spreading mysterious leaflets calling for rebellion
on the issue of peace. By this he attempted to
disrupt the organic life of the country and of the army.
With Rasputin he was plotting to create a clamour which
would justify the Government in opening separate peace
negotiations and throwing the Allies overboard.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, however, the unions of
zemstvos and of towns remained patriotic. So he
prohibited their meetings in order to cause demonstrations
and riots.</p>

<p>To all pleas and the warnings of those who saw
the handwriting on the wall the Emperor remained
deaf.</p>

<p>One afternoon, while I was with Rasputin in his
apartments at the palace, the Empress entered, flushed
and excited.</p>

<p>"Father! I have had such a blow. What do you
think has happened?" she gasped. "Nicholas [the Grand
Duke] has just had the audacity to read before Nikki and
myself a statement which was outrageous. I snatched
it from his hand and tore it up! Oh! it is infamous
that I should be thus treated!"</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked the monk, in his slow,
deliberate way. "Do not distress thyself, my sister."
And he made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>"He has declared that you, our dear Father, have
become the ruler of Russia; that Protopopoff was ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>pointed
through you, and that about you is centred a
clique of enemy spies and charlatans, and he actually
urged Nikki to protect Olga and myself from you!
When he had finished his statement, fearing that he
had gone too far, Nicholas said, 'Now call your Cossacks
and have me killed and buried in your garden.' Nikki
merely smiled."</p>

<p>"He would hear nothing against thee, I hope," said
Rasputin anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Nikki assured him that I had nothing to
do with politics, and dismissed the allegations by declaring
that he entirely disbelieved them."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed the monk; but afterwards,
when he sat in the room, he remained silent and thoughtful
for a long time.</p>

<p>At last he exclaimed aloud to me:</p>

<p>"Miliukoff must be removed. While he lives we are
all in danger. We must try another method."</p>

<p>Matters had now reached a most desperate crisis, for
on the following day Vladimir Purishkevitch, who had
opposed the Government so strenuously in spite of his
monarchical affiliations, came to see the Tsar to warn
him also of the evil forces about him. But His Majesty
took no heed. Therefore, two days later, he delivered
from the tribune of the Duma some terrible allegations
against the camarilla.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rasputin had been active, and, with
St&uuml;rmer's aid, had got hold of a man named Dubrovin,
the leader of "the Black Hundred" and a close associate
of the "dark forces." This man had, in turn,
induced a man named Prohozhi, a member of the
organisation, to accept a sum of money in return for
the assassination of Miliukoff by means of a bomb.</p>

<p>All was arranged for the night of December 20th,
and Rasputin sat with the Empress eagerly awaiting
news that the deed had been accomplished. Instead of
that, however, Protopopoff rang up from his house in
Petrograd to say that Prohozhi had, on reflection, hesitated
to harm Miliukoff, and moreover had revealed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
young Prince Felix Youssoupoff and several others the
whole of the conspiracy!</p>

<p>When told of this the Empress fainted. She saw
that all was now lost. Indeed, on the following day
Miliukoff rose in the Duma and made a second and
more powerful attack upon the camarilla, singling out
Protopopoff as one of the worst offenders. Again he
held in his hand his famous bundle of documents,
evidence of the treachery of the "dark forces," and in
a magnificent speech he defied the Government, and
urged the people to judge matters for themselves in the
light which those documents would cast upon events.
In that latest denunciation of Rasputin and his friends
there was a ring that resounded through Europe.</p>

<p>The Tsar had again left for the front, while the
Empress, nervous and trembling, held Rasputin and Anna
ever at her side. The precious trio which had wrecked
Russia were now seriously perturbed at the ugly state
of public opinion. A dark storm-cloud had arisen, but
Rasputin, with his boldness and contempt for the people,
assured the Empress that there was no cause for anxiety,
and that all would be well.</p>

<p>The s&eacute;ances of the sister-disciples in Petrograd had
been suspended, for the monk remained at the palace,
and scarcely ever left it. Protopopoff came daily to consult
with the Empress, with her mock-pious favourite
and the treacherous pro-German Fredericks, for yet another
fresh plot was being formed against those who were
so antagonistic to the Government, a plot which was to be
worked by unscrupulous <i>agents-provocateurs</i>, with the
object of placing among their effects incriminating correspondence
relating to a widespread conspiracy (which
did not exist) to overthrow the monarchy and suppress
the House of Romanoff. The idea, having originated in
Rasputin's fertile brain, had been taken up with frantic
haste, for each member of the "dark forces" had decided
that "something must be done," and that the situation
had become most perilous for them all.</p>

<p>In those snowy December days, the people at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
realised that they were being tricked, and that the
German-born Empress was striving, with her sycophants
and with the "holy" rascal, for a separate peace.
Secret meetings were being held everywhere in Petrograd,
the police were making indiscriminate arrests, and
Schl&uuml;sselburg was already overflowing with its human
victims whom Rasputin had indicated, for a hostile word
from him meant imprisonment or death. He was, indeed,
Tsar of All the Russias.</p>

<p>Such was the breathless state of things at Tsarskoe-Selo
in the last days of December.</p>

<hr />

<p>Then came the final dramatic coup.</p>

<p>Of its exact details I have no knowledge. I give&mdash;as
I have given all through this narrative of fact&mdash;only
what I <i>know</i> to be actual truth.</p>

<p>On December 29th, at eleven o'clock, I left the palace
to take a message to Protopopoff, and to interview the
much-travelled Hardt, who was coming to Petrograd
from Stockholm with his usual fortnightly dispatch from
Berlin. I returned to the Palace about eight o'clock in
the evening, when I received a message through one of
the silk-stockinged servants, whose duty it was to wait
upon "his holiness," to the effect that the monk had
gone suddenly to Petrograd upon urgent business, and
would return on the morrow.</p>

<p>Naturally, I accepted the message, ate my dinner,
read the paper, and after a chat with Madame Vyrubova,
who lived in the adjoining apartments, I retired to bed.</p>

<p>Next day I returned to the Gorokhovaya, but the
monk had not come back. Countess Ignatieff called upon
him, but I had to express my ignorance as to his whereabouts.
I told her that he might possibly have gone
upon another pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Late that night I went back to the palace, where I
found Madame Vyrubova much perturbed.</p>

<p>"It is strange, F&eacute;odor!" she exclaimed. "He never
leaves Petrograd without first informing me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
I set her mind at rest by suggesting that, as affairs
were so critical, he was probably with St&uuml;rmer and Protopopoff
plotting further man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p>Next night, however, a thrill went through the Court,
as well as through the Russian people, by the six-word
announcement in the Exchange newspapers, which coldly
said:</p>

<p>"<i>Gregory Rasputin has ceased to exist.</i>"</p>

<p>I read the statement aghast. I saw Anna Vyrubova,
who was beside herself with grief and anxiety, and for a
moment I spoke with the distracted Empress. Then I
left with all haste for the capital.</p>

<p>On arrival I learnt at the Ministry of the Interior
that a policeman on night duty along the Moika Canal
had heard shots and cries coming from a house belonging
to the young Prince Felix Youssoupoff, who had
married a cousin of the Tsar, and who was well known in
London, where he passed each "season." In the house
were the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovitch, ex-Minister of
the Interior Kvostov, Deputy Purishkevitch, and others.
When the policeman went to ask what had happened, he
received no explanation.</p>

<p>A little later two motor-cars drove up to the door.
In one of the cars a large bundle was placed. It was the
body of Rasputin. Beside this bundle a man took his
seat and ordered the chauffeur to drive to an island at
the mouth of the Neva. Traces of blood were left in
the garden. There were also marks of blood on the ice
of the frozen Neva, where the car had stopped. Near
these marks was a freshly made hole, and close to the
hole lay a pair of blood-stained rubber shoes.</p>

<p>Alexandra Feodorovna, frantic and bewildered, informed
the Emperor by telegraph, and by the time he had
returned the monk's body had been recovered from
the river. I was present at the Mass served by the
Petrograd Metropolitan Pitirim, an evil-liver of Rasputin's
creation, after which I went with the body, which
was conveyed to Tsarskoe-Selo. There, at the burial,
Protopopoff was one of the chief mourners, and he, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>gether
with General Voyeykoff, Fredericks, and the Emperor
himself, carried the silver coffin containing the remains
of one of the worst rascals in Christendom, while
the Tsaritza, Anna, and the whole Court followed in deep
mourning.</p>

<p>Such a scandal roused the ire of the people to fever
heat, but it freed me of my hateful compact, and I
cut myself adrift for ever from the fascinating Madame
Vyrubova and her vicious circle.</p>

<hr />

<p>Perhaps, in concluding this volume of strange and
amazing reminiscences, which I have written with the
sole purpose of revealing the truth to Europe, I cannot
do better than summarise the career of Rasputin as
Alexander Yablonovski, one of our ablest Russian critics,
has done. He declared that the part of the Black Monk
in history was an era in itself.</p>

<p>Practically the entire historic r&ocirc;le of Rasputin consisted
of the fact that he united all Russia in a general
hatred for the dark, irresponsible forces.</p>

<p>The Imperial Duma, the Imperial Council, the united
nobility, the social organisations, the Press&mdash;all were permeated
by the same conviction, namely, that it was high
time to remove from the Russian political arena the Government
gamblers.</p>

<p>More than that, Rasputin became even a matter of
concern to Europe. The foreign Press printed articles
about him. The foreign ambassadors cabled long reports
in code to their Governments in connection with him. But,
of course, to Europe he was more of a sad anecdote than
an historical fact. To Russia, on the other hand, he was
not only a fact, he was an era.</p>

<p>Russia has experienced immeasurable humiliation on
account of him. But this humiliation has fused the
Empire into a single body, creating citizens out of human
pulp.</p>

<p>Russians all their lives have fought the irresponsible
bureaucracy. Her literature, Press, science, parties, all,
according to their resources, plucked the roots of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
rotten plant. But how big were the results of their half-century
of labour?</p>

<p>And then a Siberian mujik appeared, and against his
own will he cut the arteries of the dark force, he stamped
it in the mud, spitting at the very principle, the very idea,
of autocratic bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Rasputin was killed for the purpose of cleansing
Russia of the dark forces. Yet, alas! his evil influence
lived to bear fruit in Germany's favour even after the
Revolution and the downfall of the Romanoffs.</p>

<p>No more sinister or astounding figure has ever appeared
in all history, and the memory of no one is
more bitterly hated in Russia than that of Gregory the
ne'er-do-well, the erotic scoundrel and assassin, who held
the fate of the Russian Empire within the hollow of
his hand.</p>
